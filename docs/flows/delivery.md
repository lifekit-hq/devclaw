# Delivery flows — how work becomes merged code

How a goal's dispatches turn into PRs, how those PRs reach `main`, and where
the dispatch-cap backstop sits. Three delivery shapes exist; which one a
dispatch uses decides the PR shape you see on GitHub.

Automerge is resolved per goal **before** any of this runs: the project
registry's `automerge` override wins, else the fleet-wide
`DEVCLAW_GOAL_AUTOMERGE` default (`goal/merge.py:resolve_automerge`). "On"
means the tick is handed a merger callable; "off" means it is handed none.

## Shape 1 — per-action mode (legacy rows only): one task = one PR

Only goals predating the executing-only lifecycle (`lifecycle=NULL` rows —
`goal/delivery_strategy.py` picks per-action for those alone; every goal
created today gets Shape 2). Every dispatch forks a fresh branch off current
`main`.

```
              heartbeat dispatches an advance
                        |
                        v
        workspace reset to origin/main  (pristine checkout)
                        |
                        v
              engineer runs in sandbox
              commits -> opens PR #N
                        |
                        v
              sandbox verify gate runs
                        |
          +-------------+--------------+
          | gate PASSED               | gate FAILED / task failed
          v                           v
   automerge ON?                 PR left open
     |        |                  counts +1 toward dispatch cap
     | yes    | no               settle detail records the failure
     v        v
  squash-   PR left open,
  merge     settle detail says
  to main   "pr_state=open (unmerged —
     |       owner review pending)"
     v
  next dispatch forks from
  UPDATED main -> no overlap
```

**Automerge off + dependent tasks is a misconfiguration in this mode**: the
next dispatch forks from a `main` that lacks the previous (unmerged) delivery,
so the engineer re-implements or conflicts. The goal branch (Shape 2) exists
to prevent exactly this — legacy rows can be cancelled and recreated.

## Shape 2 — goal branch (the standard shape): one goal = one PR, many commits

Every goal with `lifecycle="executing"` — i.e. every goal created since the
spec-008 shrink. The worker plans in-sandbox (speckit `specs/*/` artifacts in
the repo); the shared goal branch is the delivery surface.

```
        every dispatch checks out the SHARED
        branch  goal/<goal-id>   (not main)
                        |
                        v
        advance k commits STACK on advance k-1
        all pushes go to the SAME PR
                        |
                        v
        automerge deliberately SKIPPED per advance
        (merging would delete the shared branch
         and fork the next advance back to main)
                        |
                        v
        done-gate = the single review moment
        for the one cumulative PR
```

No overlap by construction, nothing for automerge to do mid-goal. This shape
is safe with automerge off.

## Shape 3 — programs: one program = a stack of PRs + reconcile at settle

Programs are the queue's DAG substrate. Since the spec-008 shrink nothing
host-side *produces* a plan (the default planner refuses loudly), so a
program runs only when a caller submits an explicitly pre-planned DAG. Each
task opens its own PR **based on the previous task's branch** (closeloop
#66 → #67 → #68).

A program settles with `gate_passed=None` (many per-task gates, no single
verdict), so Shape 1's automerge can't touch the stack. Before 2026-07-09 the
goal burned follow-up dispatches shepherding its own PRs to main — and when a
shepherding dispatch landed the content as one consolidating squash, the
source PRs stayed open as zombies. The **reconcile step** replaces that:

```
        program settles "done"  (automerge resolved ON)
                        |
                        v
        for each PR in the stack, IN ORDER (base-most first):
                        |
        +---------------+------------------------------+
        |               |               |              |
        v               v               v              v
   already        diff already     mergeable +    conflicting /
   merged/closed  on main          checks green   checks red / probe failed
        |         (reverse-apply        |              |
        |          test passes)         |              |
        v               v               v              v
      skip        close PR with     squash-merge   LEFT OPEN with the
                  "superseded"      (same merger   reason in the summary
                  comment           as Shape 1)        |
                                                       v
                                          surfaced in finished_detail;
                                          the owner decides whether a
                                          fix is worth it
```

Sequential on purpose: merging PR k re-bases k+1 and re-runs its checks, so
k+1's state only means something after k landed. Every branch is best-effort —
a failed probe/close/merge degrades to "left open", never breaks the tick.
With automerge off the reconcile step does not run at all; the owner reviews
program PRs by hand, same contract as Shape 1.

## The dispatch cap (runaway backstop, all shapes)

`cap = len(backlog) + 2` (it no longer widens on a checklist — the checklist
is gone with the host planning chain). Progress-aware since #172/#173:

```
   dispatch            -> counter +1
   settle SUCCESSFUL   -> counter -1   (done; gate passed OR gateless —
                                        reviews, programs, no-gate tasks)
   settle FAILED       -> stays        (failed run, or gate FAILED)

   counter >= cap      -> goal BLOCKED, owner notified
   owner steer/resume  -> unblocks, counter reset to 0
```

Both `steer_goal` and `resume_goal` clear the counter; the cap block is
human-gated by design — unlike `mechanical:prep`, it never auto-heals.

Only a goal looping on **broken** dispatches accumulates to the cap. A
healthy goal — including one that grounds every delivery in a read-only
verification review — never blocks. Churn on successful-but-aimless work is
caught by the direction evaluator (every `EVAL_EVERY` deliveries) and the 6h
no-progress watchdog, not by this counter.

## Field history that shaped this

- 2026-06-26 `finance-sentry-mcp-v3/v4` — PR fan-out / shared-branch deletion
  → Shape 2's skip-automerge rule and stacked goal branch.
- 2026-07-05 `closeloop-bench` — planner claimed "PR merged" for an unmerged
  PR → settle detail now states the PR's real state, built after the merge
  attempt.
- 2026-07-07 `closeloop-mission-v2` blocked at cap 6 with all work merged
  → #172 refund for gated deliveries.
- 2026-07-09 `closeloop-mission-v2` blocked again on its own on_track
  verification reviews; five zombie superseded PRs found open on closeloop
  → #173 refund-all-successful-settles + the Shape 3 reconcile step.
