"""Quality-characterization driver — harder tasks on the safe todo-fullstack-demo.

Step 1 of the "make green mean trustworthy" dogfood: run a basket of
deliberately HARDER tasks than the small machine-verifiable backend tickets
proven so far — ambiguous spec, multi-file change, a pure-UI/judgment component
whose change the backend gate does NOT cover — through the REAL engine
(run_sandcastle -> docker sandbox -> worker runner -> claude), gate each with the
backend pytest suite, deliver each as a PR (open_pr; standalone tasks do NOT
auto-merge), then read every diff adversarially.

This is the CURRENT harness (babysitting preamble + _QUALITY_BAR + test-integrity
gate, all deployed) — so the resulting diffs are the honest quality baseline the
new pre-PR review gate will be measured against.

Wiring mirrors measure_passrate.py / the server: StateStore +
TaskQueue(runner=run_sandcastle), each task on its OWN fresh clone, sequential.

Run INSIDE the devclaw-mcp container (has docker + claude OAuth + gh), with the
workroot under the container workspace prefix so sandboxes can mount the clones:
    DEVCLAW_EXEC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6 \
    MEASURE_WORKROOT=/var/lib/devclaw/workspaces/qmeasure \
    python3 /var/lib/devclaw/qdriver/measure_quality_todo.py
