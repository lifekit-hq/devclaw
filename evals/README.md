# DevClaw evals

Two layers of measurement against the chef:

1. **Sandbox e2e suite** (`sandbox_e2e.py` + `run_all.py`) — isolated, scenario-driven runs that exercise every real path the chef supports (single task, full goal lifecycle, scope grill, blocked planner, steered goal, failing verify, no-progress watchdog, quota pause, off-track done-gate). Default mode uses stub cognition (free, deterministic, CI-runnable) and the stub engine (no docker, no real PRs); opt into real `claude --print` with `--cognition claude`. **This is the regression metric** — run it before/after any change that touches the runtime path.

2. **Real-pipeline harnesses** — drive the actual `claude + docker + worker runner` pipeline end-to-end against a real repo. Used for pass-rate measurement, gate-discrimination validation, and quality-vs-greenness checks. These cost real OAuth quota and dispatch real PRs; treat them as periodic measurement, not CI.

## Sandbox e2e suite

```bash
# Full suite (free, deterministic, ~30s):
.venv/bin/python evals/run_all.py

# Single scenario (full trace + per-tick goal-state snapshot):
.venv/bin/python evals/sandbox_e2e.py --scenario blocked_planner

# Real claude (burns quota; opt-in, periodic):
.venv/bin/python evals/run_all.py --cognition claude

# Subset:
.venv/bin/python evals/run_all.py --only blocked_planner,scope_grill_happy
```

Each run writes three artifacts under `evals/runs/sandbox-<scenario>-<ts>/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `trace.json` | Machine-diffable event log: every cognition call (role, model, prompt hash, latency), every tick (incoming lifecycle/phase → outcome), every dispatch / delivery / notification. |
| `timeline.md` | Human-readable per-event narrative — read this when something looks off. |
| `summary.json` | The metric: pass/fail, counts by category, expect-block evaluation. |
| `goal-state/` | Snapshot of the goal's on-disk artifacts (`STATUS.md`, `log.md`, `deliveries.md`, `discovery.md`, `spec.md`, `inbox.md`) so the chef's recorded "mind" is inspectable after the fact. |

### Scenarios

Each scenario is a YAML fixture under `evals/sandbox/scenarios/<id>.yaml`. The schema declares the cognition stub responses, the setup (goal definition / MCP call / grill idea), and an `expect` block listing the predicates the run must satisfy.

| id | mode | What it exercises |
|---|---|---|
| `single_task` | mcp | One direct `implement_feature` call — no goal layer. |
| `goal_existing_project` | goal | Full lifecycle against a repo that already exists; multi-tick. |
| `goal_new_project` | goal | Build-from-scratch on an empty workspace. |
| `scope_grill_happy` | grill | Vague idea → grill asks one question → finalizes spec. |
| `scope_grill_decides` | grill | Decide-instead-of-ask path: no questions, spec on turn 1. |
| `blocked_planner` | goal | Planner returns `decision=blocked` → phase blocked + owner ping. |
| `steered_goal` | goal | User calls `steer_goal` mid-run; next plan sees the steering. |
| `failing_verify` | goal | Task with a failing verify_cmd; chef must NOT open a PR. |
| `stuck_no_progress` | goal | Goal sits in executing for > NO_PROGRESS_S; watchdog fires once. |
| `quota_pause` | goal | Cognition raises usage-limit; layer pauses (zero tokens). |
| `done_gate_off_track` | goal | Planner proposes done → evaluator says off_track → goal continues. |

### Expect predicates

The `expect:` block evaluates against the captured trace + the goal's final on-disk state:

```yaml
expect:
  final_phase: blocked
  final_lifecycle: executing
  blocked_on_contains: "Which database"
  outcomes_contain: [blocked]
  cognition_by_role_min:
    goal_planner: 1
  counts_eq:
    deliveries: 0
  notify_owner_contains:
    - "needs you"
    - "Which database"
  log_contains:
    - "blocked: Which database"
```

Predicates supported: `final_phase`, `final_lifecycle`, `blocked_on_contains`, `outcomes_contain`, `cognition_by_role_eq`, `cognition_by_role_min`, `counts_eq` (ticks / cognition_calls / dispatches / deliveries / notifications), `counts_min`, `notify_owner_contains`, `log_contains`, `mcp_result_contains`, `grill_final_action`, `grill_questions_eq`, `grill_questions_min`.

Add a new scenario by dropping a YAML in `evals/sandbox/scenarios/`. No runner edits required.

## Real-pipeline harnesses

| Harness | What it measures |
|---|---|
| `measure_passrate.py` | Single-task pass rate on a real backend repo (`implement_feature` / `fix_bug` tasks on `lifekit-dashboard`, gated by `cd backend && dotnet test`, delivered as PRs). The June-15 must-have. |
| `measure_quality_todo.py` | Quality vs gate-greenness on harder tasks (ambiguous / multi-file / pure-UI tasks on `todo-fullstack-demo`; PRs reviewed adversarially after the gate passes). |
| `validate_review_gate.py` | Discrimination power of the pre-PR review gate. |
| `e2e_trace.py` | Single-goal live trace — points at a real `DEVCLAW_GOALS_DIR` and ticks one goal under the trace recorder. |

```bash
# inside the devclaw-mcp container or a host with claude + docker + the dotnet image:
.venv/bin/python evals/measure_passrate.py
.venv/bin/python evals/measure_quality_todo.py
DEVCLAW_REVIEW_MODEL=sonnet .venv/bin/python evals/validate_review_gate.py
.venv/bin/python evals/e2e_trace.py --mode live --goals-dir ~/memory/goals --goal-id <id>
```

Each driver wires the engine exactly like the server does (`StateStore` + `TaskQueue(runner=run_sandcastle)`), so what it measures is what production behaves like. No mocks past the test boundary.

## Production-readiness gate ladder

"Production" for devclaw = the chef MCP server running in the `devclaw-mcp` container that the OpenClaw waiter connects to. Shipping = merging to `main` and bumping that container. Before shipping a non-trivial change, walk the ladder. Each gate states what it proves, its cost, and when to run it.

| # | Gate | What it proves | Cost | Run when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | `pytest -q` (~1226 unit) | The static contract: types, pure functions, prompt loading, store invariants. | seconds, free | every change |
| L2 | `run_all.py` (stub e2e, 11 scenarios) | Orchestration regression: every runtime path (single-task, full lifecycle, grill, blocked planner, steered goal, failing verify, watchdog, quota pause, off-track done-gate). Stub cognition + stub engine. | ~30s, free | every change touching runtime path |
| L3 | `run_all.py --cognition claude` | Real cognition makes sensible decisions on the same 11 scenarios. Catches prompt drift and decision-quality regressions. | ~2-3 min, OAuth quota | before merging anything that touches a prompt or cognition seam |
| L4 | `measure_passrate.py` (5 lifekit-dashboard tasks) | The full pipeline (run_sandcastle → docker → worker runner → claude → open_pr) actually ships verified PRs. The end-to-end smoke. | ~30-60 min, OAuth quota, 5 real PRs | pre-release, after any engine/delivery change |
| L5 | `measure_quality_todo.py` (harder todo-fullstack tasks) | Deliverable quality holds on ambiguous/multi-file/pure-UI tasks where the gate alone can't tell good from bad. | ~60 min, OAuth quota, real PRs reviewed adversarially | periodic (monthly), after any quality-bar/preamble change |
| L6 | `validate_review_gate.py` (3 real green + 2 synthetic bad diffs) | The pre-PR review gate discriminates: low false-positive on real green diffs, catches dead/no-test diffs. | ~5 min, OAuth quota | whenever review_diff/review prompt changes |
| L7 | `e2e_trace.py --mode live` against one real goal | The live tick path (real cognition, real engine, real goal store) emits the trace shape the harness expects — no blind refactor regressions in the on-disk goal artifacts. | ~5 min + real engine dispatch, OAuth quota | pre-release smoke |
| L8 | Field ops: monitor the deployed waiter+chef | Real users (one — you), real goals, real PRs. The only honest validation that nothing in this list missed something. | ongoing | always, with post-mortem on every surprise |

L1+L2 are CI-friendly (free, deterministic). L3+ burn OAuth quota and L4/L5 dispatch real PRs to public repos — treat them as periodic measurement, not CI. When a gate fails, fix the root cause; don't bypass.

A change isn't production-ready until L1-L4 are green on the branch and L7 (one real goal traced) shows no shape regression. L5/L6 are higher-frequency periodic gates; L8 is continuous.

## What's missing on purpose

There's no harness for the build-from-scratch interview flow — the spec-kit elicitation (`build_project` / `answer_question` / `approve_spec`) and its `evals/run.py` golden-project harness were removed as drift (vault explicitly rejected the multi-pass spec-kit flow). Scope alignment now lives on the OpenClaw waiter via the `scope_grill` MCP tool; build-from-scratch is expressed as a normal goal with `done_when` (and an optional pre-grilled `spec`). Measure it through the durable goal layer instead.

## Running the v0.1 proof (issue #178)

v0.1's promise is measured, not built: **10 real tickets across ≥2 registered projects →
score merged-WITHOUT-rework/10, pass bar ≥6/10 with ≤2 harness-bucket failures.** The
dispatch half reuses `measure_passrate.py` (L4); the *verdict* half is yours — that's the
whole point (merged-without-rework is a human judgment at the boundary, not a gate the
harness can pass itself).

1. **Prereq — deploy main to the VPS** and build the sandbox image(s) for each project's
   toolchain (see `docs/runbooks/live-shakedown.md` §1). The proof must run the *shipped* code.
2. **Pick 10 real tickets** from ≥2 projects' actual backlogs (not synthetic). Put them in a
   basket file — copy `evals/baskets/v01-proof.example.json`, one entry per ticket with its
   own `repo_url` + `verify_cmd` (so one run spans multiple projects). Tell each engineer to
   add focused tests and not weaken the suite, so the gate is meaningful.
3. **Dispatch them** (sequential, quota-safe; each is cloned fresh + delivered as a PR):
   ```bash
   DEVCLAW_SANDBOX_IMAGE=<img> DEVCLAW_EXEC_MODEL=<model> \
     .venv/bin/python evals/measure_passrate.py --basket evals/baskets/v01-proof.json
   ```
   Optional control run for the trend-detector value question: prepend `DEVCLAW_TREND_ENABLED=0`.
4. **Render the verdict** — review each PR on GitHub and fill the #178 scorecard:
   merged-without-rework/10 + a `harness | model | spec` bucket per miss. *A green gate is
   not "merged without rework."* The tool prints this reminder at the end.

The JSON report (`evals/runs/passrate-*.json`) captures PRs + gate results per ticket; the
merged-without-rework column and the buckets are the human layer on top.

## Token-burn profile (`burn_profile.py`)

Where a worker's context actually goes — pure mechanism over the events
table, zero LLM, read-only. Attributes each rise in the agent's own
`usage_update.used` to the tool call that preceded it.

```bash
# one task in detail (default: newest implement_feature)
.venv/bin/python evals/burn_profile.py [task_id_prefix]

# the last N tasks bucketed by tool + command shape — systemic waste, not
# one session's accident
.venv/bin/python evals/burn_profile.py --aggregate 25
```

Reads `$DEVCLAW_DB` (default `./devclaw.db`). On the deployed instance run it
inside the container against `/var/lib/devclaw/devclaw.db`. Use it before
tuning any worker skill for context cost — the 2026-09-02 profile of 25
tasks overturned two confident hunches (see the module docstring).
