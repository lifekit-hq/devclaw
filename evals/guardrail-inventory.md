# Guardrail inventory — the ADR 0004 step-1 audit (2026-07-20)

The input to the eval-driven guardrail-shedding program
([ADR 0004](../docs/decisions/0004-eval-workbench.md)). Point-in-time audit of
every mechanism that intervenes between the model and the outcome, classified
per the ADR's cognitive-vs-structural split, with its off-switch (A/B seam),
cost, and measuring instrument. Lives in `evals/` because it is eval-tranche
working data (the runner is a sibling of the thing measured), not a maintained
reference doc — re-audit before trusting file:line refs after major changes.

Legend: **C** = COGNITIVE (shed candidate) · **S** = STRUCTURAL (never-shed,
out of scope) · **H** = HYBRID (structural contract, cognitive implementation —
the cognitive half is the movable part).

## A. quality/ — worker / gate-layer (instrument: `measure_passrate`)

### A1. Adversarial review gate + degradation ladder — **H (cognitive core)** — *locked shed-candidate #1*
- `devclaw/quality/__init__.py` — `review_diff`, `review_gate` (single reviewer wrapped in the degradation ladder); wired in `task_queue._review_failure`, enable check `_review_gate_enabled`.
- What: after verify+integrity pass, a Claude pass reads the diff vs the ticket and returns approve/request_changes; `request_changes` re-enters the retry loop.
- Cost: **1 Claude call per successful code task** (per-file fan-out on the degrade ladder can burst up to `_DEGRADE_MAX_FILES_DEFAULT`=40 calls). Heavy misfire history: #210 (timeout→fail-closed→burned retries), #224 (generated-diff crash), #227 (reviewed wrong repo), #245 (quota sub-quorum misread as defect), #281 (ladder). *The N≥2 diverse-lens panel (#254) was deleted 2026-07-28 (#409) — measured dead at N=1 for weeks.*
- Structural part (never-shed): the fail-closed contract — unparseable/crash RAISES, never approves. Cognitive part (shed): the review judgment itself, the `filter_reviewable_diff` generated-file heuristic.
- A/B: per-project `review_gate` registry override turns it fully off; the degrade ladder is toggled by the `_DEGRADE_ENABLED` / `_DEGRADE_MAX_FILES_DEFAULT` constants (formerly `DEVCLAW_REVIEW_DEGRADE*`, inlined #410 — never set off-default). Gap: no single env kills the base gate — a `DEVCLAW_REVIEW_GATE` env would complete the seam.

### A2. Browser-E2E gate — **H**
- `devclaw/quality/browser_gate.py` (~277 LOC); wired `task_queue._browser_gate_failure`, `_browser_gate_mode`.
- What: a diff touching web-UI path globs must carry a passing Playwright `browser_report` (executed>0, 0 failed) or it fails closed and retries.
- Cost: zero LLM (pure verdict fold). History: #264 birth, #278 library-only false-positive scoping, the cmn-tab-group 14h wedge.
- Structural part: "UI must be exercised before it ships" fail-closed contract. Cognitive/movable: the hardcoded `DEFAULT_FRONTEND_GLOBS`/`DEFAULT_LIBRARY_GLOBS` path heuristics + flexible/strict decision — brittle glob taste a model could judge.
- A/B: `DEVCLAW_GOAL_BROWSER_GATE=0` kills the gate (env kill-switch); the flexible/strict stance is the per-project `browser_gate_mode` registry override over the `BROWSER_GATE_MODE` fleet default (formerly `DEVCLAW_GOAL_BROWSER_GATE_MODE`, inlined #410).

### A3. Browser-gate reachability judge — **C**
- `devclaw/quality/reachability.py` (~116 LOC); wired `task_queue._browser_reachability_clears`.
- What: a cognition call that can reason away A2's false positive (changed UI not rendered in the running app) — only runs on a proven `reachable=="no"` would-block path.
- Cost: 1 Claude call, rare (zero-token on all other paths). A guardrail compensating for another guardrail's bluntness. Strictly safe to drop (can only relax a block).
- A/B: always on — the strictly-safe (relax-only) valve was inlined from `DEVCLAW_GOAL_BROWSER_REACHABILITY` to `BROWSER_REACHABILITY_ENABLED=True` (#410); flip the constant to A/B it. Moot when A2 off.

### A4. eval_judge — out of scope (this IS the instrument)
- `devclaw/quality/eval_judge.py` (~155 LOC). Offline scoring, not a runtime guardrail. ADR step 3 upgrades it. List, don't shed.

### A5. Test-integrity scan — **S (locked never-shed)**
- `devclaw/loom/test_integrity.py` (~208 LOC); wired `task_queue._integrity_failure`. Pure diff scan for deleted tests / added skips. Zero LLM.

## B. goal/ — goal-layer cognition (instrument: `sandbox_e2e`/`run_all` + `dry_*`)

### B1. Done-gate ("done is a proposal") — **H / S-locked**
- `devclaw/goal/tick_donegate.py`: `_done_gate_review_brief` (~95-line hardcoded review-prompt rubric), `_resolve_done_gate`, `_open_done_gate`.
- Structural (locked never-shed): done is a proposal gated on grounded evaluation. Cognitive/movable: the review-brief prose — per-clause evidence + structural-health rubric is prompt scaffolding that babysits; could shrink as the model internalizes it.
- Cost: 1 review dispatch (full sandbox agent) + 1 evaluator call per done-proposal. History: finance-sentry-mcp vague-report-stamped-achieved; closeloop App.tsx 1827 LOC.
- A/B: `DEVCLAW_GOAL_VERIFY_DONE` toggles the review dispatch (artifact-only fallthrough).

### B2. Direction evaluator + periodic cadence — **H**
- `devclaw/goal/evaluator.py` (~584 LOC). Structural: grounded-eval contract. Cognitive/movable: the periodic mid-flight cadence.
- Cost: 1 call every `DEVCLAW_GOAL_EVAL_EVERY` deliveries + at done-gate. A/B: already — `DEVCLAW_GOAL_EVAL_EVERY=0` (done-gate only).

### B3. Decomposer (up-front checklist) — **C**
- `devclaw/goal/decomposer.py`, `checklist.py` (pure schema), `planner.py` (program adapter).
- Cost: 1 deep-tier call per goal. Structured-output scaffolding compensating for planner drift.
- A/B: already — `DEVCLAW_GOAL_DECOMPOSE=0`. Instrument: `dry_decompose` + `run_all`.

### B4. Investigate / discovery / world-research stack — **C**
- `devclaw/goal/research.py`, `world_research.py` (`repo_brief.py` is zero-LLM memory — neutral).
- Cost: 1 dispatch + 1–2 cognition calls per goal. Scaffolding to stop the planner inventing shape.
- A/B: already — `DEVCLAW_GOAL_INVESTIGATE=0`. Instrument: `dry_world_research` + `sandbox_e2e`.

### B5. Firming phase — **C**
- `devclaw/goal/firmed.py`, `goal/phases/firming.py`. Cognition + owner round-trips. A/B: `DEVCLAW_GOAL_FIRMING=0` (default off).

### B6. Admission heuristics — **C**
- `devclaw/goal/admission.py`: `_check_vague_done_when` length heuristic, `_check_scope_anchor_for_from_scratch`, `_check_bare_verify_cmd` regex, `_check_standing_done_when`.
- Cost: zero LLM, ~200 LOC of hardcoded taste a model could judge in one pass. Self-flagged "length-only heuristic, intentionally simple".
- A/B: no env flag — off-switch means guarding the shape checks (presence checks stay). Medium effort.

### B7. Self-triage interceptor — **C**
- `devclaw/goal/triage.py` (~210 LOC). 1 Claude call only when a real owner ping fires (zero-token idle preserved). A/B: `DEVCLAW_SELF_TRIAGE=0`. Telemetry-measured only.

### B8. Item asserts (reality-anchored acceptance) — **H / S-leaning**
- `devclaw/goal/tick_settle.py`: `_check_one_assert_sync`, `_check_addressed_asserts` (#298, ADR 0003 #2/#4).
- Mechanical `file_exists`/`grep` enforcement at settle — fail-closed reality anchor under the LLM gate; zero LLM. The assert *contents* are decomposer-authored (cognitive), the enforcement is structural.
- A/B: `DEVCLAW_ITEM_ASSERTS=0` (operator kill-switch).

### B9. Per-item + per-workspace circuit breakers — **S (mechanical)**
- `tick_settle.py` `_apply_item_failure`/`DEVCLAW_ITEM_MAX_ATTEMPTS`; `task_queue._check_and_trip_breaker`. Anti-storm loop-guards, zero LLM. Never-shed-class.

### B10. Tick guards / auto-heal / no-progress watchdog — **S (mechanical)**
- `devclaw/goal/tick_guards.py` (~387 LOC): block handlers, damped `_autoheal_*` caps + backoff, zero-token `_check_no_progress`. #230/#235/#237. Structural.

### B11. Remote-checks / CI gate — **S**
- `devclaw/goal/remote_checks.py`; wired in `_resolve_done_gate`. Fail-closed grounded CI verification. A/B exists (`DEVCLAW_GOAL_REMOTE_CHECKS`, `DEVCLAW_GOAL_CI_GATE`) but out of scope.

## C. task_queue.py — worker orchestration (instrument: `measure_passrate`)

### C1. Retry-on-fail loop + attempt-history feedback — **H (cognitive-leaning)**
- `task_queue._run_and_settle` retry loop, `TASK_MAX_RETRIES`, attempt-failure history prompt, retry-isolation reset (#277).
- What: re-runs a gate-failing task, feeding the numbered failure history back as prompt so the agent self-corrects.
- Cost: **HIGH** — a full agent re-run + full gate stack per retry; the feedback-history prompt is compensate-for-weak-self-corrector scaffolding.
- A/B: already — `DEVCLAW_MAX_RETRIES=0`. The biggest per-run cost lever.

### C2. Quota/rate failure classifier — **H (cognitive impl, structural intent)**
- `devclaw/loom/limits.py` `classify_failure` + regex banks; vendored copy in `runner.py` `_detect_usage_limit`.
- Structural intent: never burn quota re-probing a limit. Cognitive impl: a large, chronically-patched regex bank (#189/#190 + repeated wording misses) — could move to a cheap model classify.
- Misfire history +1 (2026-07-20 unattended night): auth deliberately classified REAL ("surface, don't pause") — an expired VPS login burned the whole run window as ~58 terminal cognition failures, no pause, no ping. Fixed by adding the pausing AUTH kind (fixed re-probe + actionable re-login ping), with a STRONG/WEAK pattern split so bare 401/Unauthorized in gate-feedback prose about the app under development stays REAL (a pausing AUTH raised the misfire cost from "benign retry" to "2h account pause"). Another instance of the bank being patched per incident — evidence FOR the cheap-model-classify replacement.
- A/B: no off-switch (fail-open default REAL). Shedding = replace-not-delete; robustness win, not cost-cut. Rank last.

### C3. Worker honest-block / honest-exit — **S** — `_WORKER_BLOCKED_MARKER` fail-fast-closed path (#280); runner `_parse_blocked_reason`. Out of scope.

### C4. MAX_PAUSE_REQUEUES bound — **S (mechanical)**. Anti-infinite-loop bound. Zero LLM.

## D. openhands-runner/runner.py — worker prompt layer (instrument: `measure_passrate`)

### D1. Skills wiring + kind-wrappers + quality-bar/verify-coda/return-contract — **C**
- `_load_skills`, `_wrap_goal`, `_KIND_WRAPPERS`, `_RETURN_CONTRACT`, `_VERIFY_CODA`, `_QUALITY_BAR`, `_CONTEXT_PREAMBLE`.
- What: prepends universal + per-repo skill bundles and hardcoded quality-bar/verify-coda/return-contract prose to every worker goal.
- Cost: zero extra LLM calls but bloats every worker prompt — exactly the babysitting-scaffolding class the ADR names.
- A/B: de-facto = point `DEVCLAW_SKILLS_DIR` at an empty dir (embedded wrappers remain); no clean "no scaffolding" flag. Medium effort.

### D2. Universal + per-repo hooks — **S (mechanical extension seam)** — `_run_hook`, `DEVCLAW_HOOKS_DIR`. Deterministic scripts, not model-compensation.

### D3. Return-contract parse (`browser_report`, REPO NOTES, `BLOCKED:`) — structural proof-of-execution plumbing. Out of scope.

## E. Infra / seams (not guardrails — listed for completeness)
- `devclaw/dispatch_gate.py` — operator manual-pause + run-window (fail-open). Operator control.
- `devclaw/cognition.py`, `devclaw/model_tiers.py` — the cognition seam + tiering; the §5 eval-endpoint seam extends here (with `DEVCLAW_ACP_COMMAND`).
- `devclaw/elicitation.py` (scope grill) — human-invoked cognition tool, not an autonomous guardrail.

# Ordered shed-candidate list

Cognitive guardrails + cognitive halves of hybrids only, ranked by
(expected cost saved × ease of A/B). #1 was locked in the ADR before this
audit; the audit confirms it. **A shed still requires the full 2×2 —
this list only orders the experiments, it authorizes nothing.**

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Adversarial review gate** (A1) — *locked* | registry `review_gate`; `_DEGRADE_ENABLED` constant (gap: no base-gate env) | 1 Claude call per successful code task — biggest steady-state gate-layer burn | `measure_passrate` |
| 2 | Retry loop + attempt-history scaffolding (C1) | `DEVCLAW_MAX_RETRIES=0` | Highest per-run cost (full re-run + gate stack per retry); trivial on/off | `measure_passrate` |

| 5 | Direction-evaluator periodic cadence (B2, cognitive half) | `DEVCLAW_GOAL_EVAL_EVERY=0` (done-gate stays) | 1 call / N deliveries | goal-layer `run_all` |
| 6 | Done-gate review-brief prose (B1, cognitive half only) | `DEVCLAW_GOAL_VERIFY_DONE` (contract stays via evaluator) | 1 sandbox dispatch + eval per done-proposal; shrink the 95-line rubric | `sandbox_e2e` |
| 7 | Worker prompt scaffolding / skills / return-contract (D1) | empty `DEVCLAW_SKILLS_DIR` (no clean flag) | Per-task token bloat | `measure_passrate` |
| 8 | Browser-gate reachability judge (A3) | `BROWSER_REACHABILITY_ENABLED` constant | 1 call, rare paths only | `measure_passrate` |
| 9 | Firming phase (B5) | `DEVCLAW_GOAL_FIRMING=0` (default off) | Low incremental | `sandbox_e2e` |
| 10 | Admission heuristics (B6) | no flag — needs one added | Zero LLM; code-shrink only | `run_all` |
| 11 | Self-triage interceptor (B7) | `DEVCLAW_SELF_TRIAGE=0` | 1 call, very rare | telemetry only |
| 12 | Quota-classifier regex → model (C2, movable impl) | no off-switch (fail-open) | Replace-not-delete; robustness, not cost | n/a |
