"""Model tiering — the single cognition cost lever.

Three host-side tiers (values for ``claude --model``: an alias like
``sonnet``/``opus`` or a full id) cover every one-shot cognition role.
Which ROLE runs at which TIER is a design decision that lives in the
table below and changes by PR — it is deliberately not per-role
configuration: twelve per-role env vars existed before this module and
none was ever set to a non-default value on any host.

The in-sandbox coding agent's model is separate (``DEVCLAW_EXEC_MODEL``,
a full model id — the token/quota bulk; see ``engine/``).

Empty string → ``None`` → the account's default model.
