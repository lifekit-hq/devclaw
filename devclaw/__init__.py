"""DevClaw — a thin orchestration layer in front of OpenHands.

TypeScript is gone; this is the all-Python host runtime. The MCP server,
planner, SQLite state store, task queue, and docker-sandbox runner all live
here. The only other code is ``runner/runner.py``, which runs the
OpenHands SDK *inside* the per-task sandbox container.
