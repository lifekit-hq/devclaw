    Returns a task_id immediately; the task runs asynchronously. Poll

    ``kind`` selects the prompt bias:
      - ``implement_feature`` — new features / open-ended changes.
      - ``fix_bug`` — biases toward reading existing code first, making the
        smallest fix, not refactoring unrelated code, and running the tests.
      - ``review_repository`` — READ-ONLY code review; the agent inspects the
        workspace and writes a report, prompt-instructed NOT to modify any
        files. ``verify_cmd`` and ``open_pr`` are ignored for this kind.

    Pass verify_cmd (e.g. "dotnet test", "npm run build && npm run test:ci") to
    gate the task: after the agent finishes, DevClaw runs that command in the
    workspace and the task only succeeds if it exits 0 — the agent's own
    "I'm done" is not trusted. A failing gate marks the task failed with the
    command output captured.

    Pass open_pr=True to DELIVER a successful change as something you review: on
    ``done``, DevClaw commits it to a branch, pushes, and opens a PR (best-effort;
    needs git push auth + a GitHub remote), recording the PR URL on the task.

    Branch targeting (both optional; defaults = today's behavior — a fresh
    auto-named branch, PR to the repo's default branch):
      - ``target_branch`` — CONTINUE this branch: before the agent runs, the
        workspace is force-checked-out to it (fetched to its origin tip if it
        exists, else created off ``base_branch``; uncommitted local changes are
        discarded), and the delivery must land on it — reusing its single open
        PR when one exists. Delivery landing anywhere else fails the task.
        Also selects the branch a ``review_repository`` task reviews.
      - ``base_branch`` — the PR base and diff range (e.g. "develop"). It must
        resolve on the workspace's origin; a base that doesn't fails the task
        up front with an actionable message.

                         high-level pointer at layout, one-line status.
      - ARCHITECTURE.md — component map, data flow, cross-cutting concerns,

    skill (`skills/onboard/00-onboard.md`) enforces boundary discipline
    (no ADR reasoning in README, no quickstart in ARCHITECTURE) so the four
