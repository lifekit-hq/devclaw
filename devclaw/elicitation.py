"""The scope grill — interrogate to a shared spec.

Pure cognition: given a rough idea and the running transcript, decide the next
question (with a recommended answer) or finalize a spec.md. Stateless — the
caller (today: the ``scope_grill`` MCP tool, called turn-by-turn by the OpenClaw
waiter) holds the transcript. The chef provides the *craft* (what to ask, what
'enough' looks like); the waiter holds the conversation in Telegram.

The interview methodology is adapted from Matt Pocock's MIT-licensed ``grill-me``
skill (github.com/mattpocock/skills): interview relentlessly until shared
understanding, walk each branch resolving dependencies one-by-one, recommend an
answer per question, ask one at a time, and decide-instead-of-ask when the
answer is obvious.

No transport, no persistence — unit-testable with a stubbed ``claude_caller``.
