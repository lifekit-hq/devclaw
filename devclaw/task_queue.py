"""Async task executor — DB-driven, crash-safe, heartbeat-paced.

The MCP handler calls ``submit()`` / ``submit_program()`` and gets an id back
immediately; engine runs happen in the background and the state store is flipped
when they settle. Single-writer-to-state by design — only this queue mutates rows.

**Scheduling is reconciled from DB state, not from in-memory counters.** The core
is :meth:`_pump`: read what's runnable from the store, claim it atomically, launch
up to the concurrency caps. Three things call it — ``submit``, a task settling,
and a periodic **heartbeat tick** — and they're all idempotent because
``claim_pending`` is the final guard. Because concurrency is derived from the
``running`` rows (not a counter that dies with the process), the system is
**crash-safe**: :meth:`recover` resets orphaned ``running`` tasks at startup and
the next pump resumes them. That's the "ephemeral body / durable mind" model — a
build survives restarts.

**Cheap-idle guard:** every pump first asks the store "is there any work?" (one
COUNT) and returns immediately if not — an idle tick costs ~nothing, so we never
burn the engine on empty ticks.

Programs (DAGs): a program is planned (the planner → tasks with deps), then each
pump schedules ready tasks (deps all ``done``) up to the per-program + global
caps. A single sibling failure makes the program "sticky failed" — pending
siblings don't start, in-flight ones run to completion, then the program fails.

Notifications: standalone tasks fire their own ``notify_url`` on terminal state
(bounded retries); program-child tasks don't — only the program-level notify
fires once the program terminates (one program in, one notify out).

#: for a given task scope, and the retry prompt APPENDS the prior failure

        non-terminal are picked up by the next pump (re-planned if they never got
