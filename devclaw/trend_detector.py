"""Trend detector — the cross-session engineering practice (designed 2026-06-29).

The orchestrator that runs every heartbeat: it iterates the enabled signals,
honors per-signal cooldowns (persisted in the sqlite ``meta`` table), picks at
most one fired signal per scope per heartbeat (priority-ordered), and — when
something fires — invokes the LLM retrospective pass and writes one structured
entry to ``trends.md``.

The mechanism / cognition split applies recursively here: the *pre-filter* is
pure Python (zero tokens, runs unconditionally each heartbeat); the *cognition*
runs only when a pre-filter fires. An idle or healthy project produces zero
trends.md entries — and that's correct behavior, not a bug.

Boundary (structurally enforced by the constructor — the detector simply has no
handle to anything it shouldn't write to):
  * NEVER edits ``AGENTS.md``, never creates goals, never alters ``done_when``.
  * Writes ONLY to: ``trends.md`` (per-project or harness-self), the sqlite
    ``meta`` table (cooldown timestamps), the ``traces`` table (observability),
    and the injected notifier.
  * The boundary check ``trend_detector_only_has_safe_writes`` (Stage 5 test)
    pins this by inspecting the constructor's parameter set.

Hook points (Stage 4 wires these — Stage 1 just exposes the methods):
  * ``run_per_goal`` — inside ``goal/tick.py`` per-goal loop, where
    ``workspace_dir`` and the tracer are already in scope.
  * ``run_harness_self`` — once globally after the per-goal loop.

runs) will read.

## What just fired

- signal: {signal.id} ({signal.category})
- description: {_signal_description(signal)}
- actual value: {result.actual_value}
- threshold: {result.threshold_value}

## Bounded evidence (gathered by the pre-filter)

{json.dumps(result.evidence, indent=2, default=str)}

## Deeper refs (paths / commands you can mentally consult)

{json.dumps(result.deeper_refs, indent=2, default=str)}

## Scope

{scope_info}

## Recent prior trends (DO NOT repeat what's already noted)

{recent_excerpt}

## How to judge

Distinguish between:
- A REAL pattern worth correcting (e.g. the same module is genuinely a recurring
  bug-source, AGENTS.md genuinely needs updating, steering frequency reflects a
  real misalignment).
- A BENIGN pre-filter artifact (e.g. CHANGELOG.md naturally touched on every fix
  commit is not a "hotspot" in the recurrence sense; a project that never had
  an AGENTS.md may not yet need one if it's tiny).

If real → propose ONE concrete action (e.g. "add 'every PR must include tests'
to .agent/skills/testing.md", "consider refactoring file X — it has accumulated
14 fix-class commits"). If benign → ``proposed_action`` MUST be null.

Be neutral, terse, and specific. 1-3 sentences for the observation.

## Output

Return JSON ONLY — no prose around it, no markdown fences:

{{
  "date": "<ISO 8601 timestamp, e.g. 2026-06-29T15:00:00+00:00>",
  "signal": "{signal.id}",
  "category": "{signal.category}",
  "observation": "<1-3 sentences>",
  "evidence_refs": ["<paths or commands you'd point a reader to>"],
  "proposed_action": <null | "<one concrete action sentence>">
}}

Return the JSON now.
