"""Self-observability — the deduplicated problems catalog: the GATHERER that
feeds GitHub-Issue filing (capture + dedup + count).

**Source of truth (issue-driven-pipelines proposal, N1 / #371).** This catalog is
*not* a second backlog. GitHub Issues are the **single canonical store of intent**
— "what to do about a failure" lives there, triaged into the ``P0/P1/P2 + area:*``
taxonomy. This table is the mechanical GATHERER upstream of that: it counts the
DISTINCT root causes so the self-improving loop (``goal/self_issue.py``) can file a
*recurring* one as an Issue and link it back (``issue_number``/``issue_state``).
SQLite stays canonical for execution *state*; Issues canonical for *intent*; the
catalog is the feeder between them, never a competing to-do list a human triages
independently. Reads of this table are gatherer signals, not a backlog.

The blindness problem it closes: devclaw hits failures all day — a goal
blocks, a task settles ``failed``, a usage limit pauses the account, a cognition
call crashes — and today each one is a line in a log that scrolls away. "It
fails/stalls N times a day" is unanswerable because nothing counts the DISTINCT
root causes.

:class:`ProblemsMixin` gives :class:`~devclaw.state_store.StateStore` one method,
:meth:`ProblemsMixin.record_problem`, wired at every failure choke point. It is
pure mechanism — **no LLM, no subprocess** — so it is safe to call on any real
failure path without touching the zero-token idle guard (it fires only when a
failure actually happened, never on an idle/no-error tick).

The crux is DEDUP: two occurrences of the same root cause must collapse into ONE
row with ``count`` incremented, not two rows — otherwise the table grows without
bound (the #250 lesson). :func:`normalize` strips the variable bits of a failure
message (uuids, paths, goal/task ids, numbers, timestamps) so "lost ref for
program 3f9a…" and "lost ref for program 88bc…" fingerprint identically. The
fingerprint is ``category | normalize(kind) | normalize(message)``
(:func:`fingerprint_for`) and the write is an UPSERT keyed on it.

This module is the capture + dedup + count mechanism plus the Stage-1 accessors
that link a problem to its filed Issue. The recurrence/age-out/label *decisions*
live as pure functions in ``goal/self_issue.py``; the lifecycle *derivation*
(identified → filed → resolved) is :func:`problem_lifecycle` below — the single
home shared by the MCP ``list_problems`` tool and the console ``/problems.json``.
