"""SQLite state store for DevClaw tasks — the core append-only event log +
single-writer engine.

Tracks every task DevClaw has been asked to run, its current status, and the
result (or error) once it terminates. ``sqlite3`` is sync; a re-entrant lock
serializes access because FastMCP may touch the store from the event loop and
from background tasks. WAL mode gives concurrent reads with a single writer.

The thin typed ``meta`` wrappers (quota pause, operator hold, run windows,
workspace breaker, trend cooldowns) live on :class:`ControlPlaneMixin` in
``control.py``; the pure data (dataclasses + row mappers + literals) lives in
``rows.py``. This module holds the connection, the transaction machinery, and
the task/program/event/trace CRUD.

# the highest-volume table after traces, bounded 2026-07-18). The heartbeat

# core — pure SQLite (zero LLM calls) and batched so a first prune of a huge
