"""Per-workspace git bookmarks — last-seen-SHA persistence in the state store.

Used by the trend detector to track "what's new since last fire" without
re-iterating the whole git history every heartbeat. The detector's bookmark
lives in its OWN namespace (``trend_bookmark:<workspace>``) — separate from
any future engineer-brief bookmark so D1/D2 advancement can't interfere with
the engineer's repo-catch-up read (see plan.md "engineer brief" / PR3+).

Persistence shape mirrors the cooldown helpers landed in PR1: typed methods
on ``StateStore`` (``set_trend_bookmark`` / ``get_trend_bookmark``) backed by
the ``meta`` table. This module holds the small git-side utility the signals
need to ADVANCE that bookmark to HEAD.

    branches get squash-merged and recreated off new main), so a bookmark
    taken on yesterday's branch tip is frequently NOT reachable from today's
    HEAD. ``git diff`` from such a divergent base re-reports long-existing
    paths as newly added, and the bookmark-aware signals (D1/D2/D3) fire
    spuriously forever.

    ``git merge-base --is-ancestor`` exits 0 for a valid ancestor, 1 for a
    known-but-divergent commit, and 128 for an unknown or garbage-collected
    SHA — one call covers both the divergence and the lost-object cases.
