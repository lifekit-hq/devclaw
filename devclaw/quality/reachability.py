"""Browser-gate reachability judge — the grounded, fail-closed escape valve for
the browser-E2E gate's one known false positive.

The gate (``devclaw.quality.browser_gate``) fires MECHANICALLY on any frontend
file, on purpose: a change that "didn't declare it needs a browser" must still be
caught. That bluntness has one legitimate false positive — a UI change that is not
rendered anywhere in the RUNNING app has nothing for Playwright to exercise (a
design-system component no route imports yet; the finance-sentry ``cmn-tab-group``
that wedged for ~14h, 2026-07-17). Its real proof is its unit test + story, not a
full-app browser run.

The bulk library-only class is now exempted MECHANICALLY upstream
(``browser_gate.DEFAULT_LIBRARY_GLOBS`` — every frontend path under
``*/src/lib/*`` ⇒ ``not_triggered``, zero cognition; 2026-07-18). This judge
remains the escape valve for the REMAINING false-positive class the glob can't
express — an app-surface change that is nonetheless not rendered in the running
app (a component under ``src/app`` no route imports yet, a repo-root
``src/lib`` layout the glob doesn't match). It answers the GENERIC question: *is the changed UI
reachable in the running application?* — reasoned per-change, grounded ONLY in the
task workspace (the #227 discipline), and biased hard toward "require the run":

- The judgment is INDEPENDENT of the agent that wrote the diff (consulted by the
  settle path, never self-declared) — the gate exists precisely because an
  implementer's own green tests can't be trusted to say "no browser needed".
- It can only ever DOWNGRADE a block to a ship, and only on an affirmative
  ``reachable == "no"``. ``yes`` / ``unknown`` / unparseable / any exception all
  leave the block standing. So it is strictly safe: worst case it is a no-op and
  the gate behaves exactly as before.

Same shape as ``review_diff`` — cognition is host-side ``claude`` (OAuth, no API
key), tiered via the ``reachability`` role; prompt-building + validation are pure,
so this is unit-testable with a stubbed caller.
