"""Browser-E2E verification gate — "was the UI change actually exercised in a
real browser, or did it just pass unit tests + a static diff review?".

The gap this closes (2026-07-17, finance-sentry-ui-library): a UI change ships
green when ``verify_cmd`` is ``ng build && vitest`` — jsdom unit tests + a build,
never a browser. The adversarial review gate reads a *static diff*; the done-gate
reviewer reads *code*. Nothing boots the app in Chromium. A component like
``cmn-select`` passed every gate while throwing ``NG05105`` the instant its
dropdown opened, because no gate rendered the integrated app. The sandbox already
ships Chromium + ``@playwright/mcp`` (``.sandcastle/Dockerfile``,
``openhands-runner/sandbox-mcp.json``); what was missing is a deterministic
host-side assertion that a browser suite *actually ran and passed*.

This module is that assertion — a pure verdict function consulted at settle time,
the same shape as :mod:`devclaw.goal.remote_checks` (fail-open on *capability*
uncertainty, fail-closed on *evidence* of a broken or un-run browser suite).

Proof-of-execution contract (the crux, decided 2026-07-17): the verdict keys off
a machine-readable **Playwright JSON reporter summary** (``browser_report`` —
``{expected, unexpected, flaky, skipped}`` counts the runner parses from the
``--reporter=json`` artifact and attaches to the verify result). It does NOT
string-match ``verify_cmd`` for the word "playwright": that grep-shaped check
proves *intent*, not *execution*, and is exactly the ``evaluator.py`` existence-vs-
execution scar (a gate that asserted spec files EXISTED, not that they RAN). An
exit code of 0 is necessary but not sufficient — the gate requires a positive
*executed* count.

Verdict semantics:

- ``not_triggered`` → the diff touched no frontend path, OR every frontend path
                      it touched is library surface (``*/src/lib/*`` — a
                      library-only slice wires nothing into a running app, so a
                      full-app E2E has nothing to visit; its proof is the
                      story+spec the library build/test gate already requires) —
                      the browser gate is N/A for this change; never blocks.
                      The library exemption removes only the EXPECTATION of a
                      run: if a browser suite actually executed, its evidence
                      (``ran_passed``/``ran_failed``) is still processed in full.
- ``ran_passed``    → a browser suite executed (executed count > 0) and nothing
                      failed → gate satisfied.
- ``ran_failed``    → a browser suite executed and ≥1 test failed → blocks
                      (the correction retries with the failures fed back).
- ``never_ran``     → a frontend change shipped but no browser suite executed:
                      no ``browser_report`` at all, or a report with 0 executed
                      (exit 0 but nothing ran — the scar). The ``playwright``
                      config exists, so a browser run was expected — its absence
                      is evidence, not infrastructure. Blocks (fail closed).
- ``absent``        → a frontend change shipped and the project has NO playwright
                      config at all — nothing to run. Capability-shaped, like
                      ``remote_checks``' ``no_workflows``: blocks only under
                      ``strict`` (under ``flexible``, the default, it logs loudly
                      and falls through so a not-yet-E2E'd project isn't wedged).

The stance is ``task_queue.BROWSER_GATE_MODE`` (fleet default ``flexible``),
per-project overridable via the registry's ``browser_gate_mode``:
``flexible`` (a project with no browser suite degrades to a loud log instead of
a wedge) or ``strict`` (any frontend change with no passing browser run blocks).
``ran_failed``/``never_ran`` block in BOTH modes — those are evidence of a
problem, not capability uncertainty.

Pure module — no subprocess, no I/O. The runner parses the artifact into
``browser_report`` in-sandbox; the settle path detects ``config_present`` on the
host; this function only folds those inputs into a verdict, so it stays a
trivially-testable unit (the ``remote_checks`` / ``merge`` seam shape).
