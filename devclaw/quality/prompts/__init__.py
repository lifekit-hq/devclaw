"""The gate's own prompt templates — inside the package boundary by design.

The judge prompts (``review-gate.md``,
``browser-reachability.md``) moved here from ``devclaw/prompts/`` (2026-07-19)
so the quality gate is self-contained: everything the gate needs to render a
verdict — logic, prompts, loader — lives under ``devclaw/quality/`` and moves
as one unit when the package is extracted to its own repo.

Same loader semantics as ``devclaw.prompts.load_prompt`` (package-relative
``<slug>.md``, cached first read, always ``.format``-interpolated so ``{{ }}``
escaping is consistent); deliberately a small local copy rather than an import
of the devclaw-wide loader — the gate must not depend on devclaw's prompt dir
existing.
