"""Claude Code workspace-trust seeding — the config twin of the mise trust
seam (openhands-runner's ``_mise_run`` / ``MISE_TRUSTED_CONFIG_PATHS``).

Claude Code began hard-enforcing *workspace trust* around 2026-07: in a
directory whose ``projects[<abs-path>].hasTrustDialogAccepted`` is not set in
the user's ``.claude.json``, it **ignores that workspace's
``.claude/settings.json`` permissions**, and a non-interactive
``claude --print`` exits non-zero on the untrusted-workspace guard. Devclaw
runs ``claude`` in two spots the host ``.claude.json`` never listed (its
``projects`` map is keyed by *host* paths):

- **cognition** — ``claude --print`` for the planner/evaluator/summary, run
  from the devclaw-mcp container's cwd (``/app``); and
- **the worker** — the in-sandbox agent, at ``/workspace``.

Both dead-stopped once trust started being enforced. Seeding that one flag
restores the prior behavior. This is pure Claude *config*: no ``ANTHROPIC_*``
key (the OAuth-only pillar is untouched), no permission *widening* — the
curated allowlist is exactly what gets *restored* — and no devclaw state.
Everything here is best-effort: a config we can't read/write is left alone so
the claude call still fails loudly on its own if trust was truly the blocker;
we never mask a real failure.
