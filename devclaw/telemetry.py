"""L8 scorecard telemetry — the rolling merge / steer / first-pass counters
plan.md §Measurement direction calls out as the "PR-by-PR delta on the scorecard
signals" surface.

Two ways in:

- ``compute_scorecard(store, window_hours=168)`` — a pure function over the
  state_store's ``tasks`` and ``traces`` tables. Cheap SQL + a light Python
  pass over cognition response text (full ``response_text`` since T0.5,
  ``response_preview`` for legacy rows); no cognition call.
- ``devclaw scorecard`` (CLI) and the ``get_scorecard_metrics`` MCP tool
  wrap the same function.

Deliberately *narrow* v1: skips the VPS-side dashboard render (separate infra)
and stays out of every path the goal engine actually runs — reading only. If a
metric can't be computed exactly from what the state store carries today, we
prefer a best-effort estimate with an explicit ``estimate_notes`` field over
inventing new persistence.
