"""The engine seam.

DevClaw's orchestration (task queue, planner, state store) drives an *Engine* —
the thing that actually executes one coding task in isolation and streams back
events. The worker-runner-in-a-docker-sandbox is the only implementation today
(:func:`devclaw.engine.sandcastle.run_sandcastle`), but the orchestration
depends ONLY on this interface, never on the agent behind it.

That's the "orchestration ⊥ engine" decoupling from the architecture: the
engine is pinned but swappable behind one method, and the
orchestration stays testable with a stub engine (the tests inject one).

An Engine is any async callable ``(EngineRequest) -> EngineResult`` — a plain
async function satisfies it, which is why ``run_sandcastle`` is one.
