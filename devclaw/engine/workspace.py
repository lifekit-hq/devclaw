"""Workspace lifecycle — give the engine a clean checkout per goal action.

Folded in from goalclaw. Now that the goal layer lives INSIDE devclaw, devclaw
owns the goal↔repo↔workspace lifecycle end to end (this is the seam-relocation
the 2026-06-06 brainstorm wanted — it falls out for free once the two services
are one process). Before each code action we make the workspace a **pristine
checkout of the repo's default branch at latest origin** — clone if missing,
else fetch + hard-reset + clean. That keeps a multi-item goal's actions from
piling onto each other's branches, and naturally picks up whatever PRs got
merged since the last action.

    name of the branch the working tree ended up on. Raises
    :class:`WorkspaceError` on failure.

    The ``branch`` arg is the Pillar 1 / Pillar 2 hook: each per-item task in
    a checklist-mode goal passes ``branch="goal/<goal_id>"`` so subsequent
    items see the prior items' commits stacked on the goal branch instead of
    branching off origin/main and re-implementing the foundation (the
    2026-06-26 finance-sentry-mcp-v3 PR-fan-out failure). When the goal
    branch doesn't exist yet (first item) it is created from the default
    branch at latest origin; otherwise it is fetched + fast-forwarded to its
    own remote tip (preserving the agent's accumulated work) and rebased onto
    the latest default-branch tip so a long-running goal still tracks main.

    Injected into the goal tick so unit tests pass a no-op.
