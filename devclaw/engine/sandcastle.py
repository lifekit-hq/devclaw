"""Per-task docker sandbox runner — the production :class:`~devclaw.engine.Engine`.

This is the one concrete Engine implementation (see ``engine.py`` for the seam).
Spawns ``docker run --rm`` against the devclaw-sandbox image for each task. The
container's ENTRYPOINT runs the worker harness (``runner/runner.py``),
which streams one prefixed JSON line per event (``event: {...}``) plus a single
terminating ``result: {...}`` line. This module:

  - Translates an ``EngineRequest`` into a docker invocation.
  - Bind-mounts the host workspace into /workspace and a CURATED allowlist of
    entries under ~/.claude (default: the OAuth identity pair, as per-task
    disposable read-write COPIES — the sandbox CLI writes its own config; the
    HOST files stay untouched) into /home/agent/.claude — auth in, the host's
    personal skills/plugins/MCP/global CLAUDE.md out. See
    ``SANDBOX_CLAUDE_ALLOWLIST`` and ``_build_claude_mounts``.
  - Streams stdout line-by-line; routes ``event:`` lines through ``on_event``
    and parses the final ``result:`` line as the result.
  - Refuses to forward ANTHROPIC_API_KEY into the container (same belt +
    suspenders the runner enforces).

Container lifecycle: --rm + the per-task --name make destroy-on-exit automatic;
no persistent on-host state. But --rm dies with its own docker CLI process — if
the devclaw process is killed mid-task, the container keeps running with nothing
left to reap it. Every sandbox therefore also carries the ``devclaw.sandbox=1``
label, and :func:`sweep_orphan_sandboxes` reaps leftovers at the next startup
(wired into ``TaskQueue.recover``). Tests inject a stub runner (via TaskQueue's
``runner`` param) so they don't need docker.
