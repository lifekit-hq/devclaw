"""The prompts package — markdown prompt templates, one file per role.

Why disk and not Python strings: prompts are prose the model reads, not code.
Editing one shouldn't require touching Python (and the review/CI overhead that
brings); diffing one across versions shouldn't be lost in the Python noise.
Keeping them as ``.md`` files makes prompt changes a one-file, prose-only
review.

Layout: ``devclaw/prompts/<slug>.md``. Each ``.md`` file is a complete prompt
(system role + structural constraints), interpolated at call time via
``str.format`` with whatever ``**vars`` the caller passes. Composite prompts
(grill = rules + spec-shape + transcript + closing + contract) stay assembled
in Python because the dynamic parts (transcript turns, finalize bit) need
real code — but the static blocks they assemble live here.

Use:

    from devclaw.prompts import load_prompt
    prompt = load_prompt("goal-evaluator")
    prompt = load_prompt("scope-grill")
