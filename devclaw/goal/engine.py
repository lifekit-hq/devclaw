"""The engine seam — in-process, replacing goalclaw's HTTP MCP client.

When the goal layer lived in a separate service it dispatched to devclaw over
streamable-http MCP and polled task rows back as a camelCase JSON blob. Folded
in, the seam collapses to a direct call into :class:`TaskQueue` /
:class:`StateStore`: ``dispatch`` submits a task/program and ``poll`` reads the
row straight from SQLite. This deletes the HTTP transport, the bearer token, the
``/wake`` endpoint, AND the whole "polled `done` before `pr_url` was written"
timing race — in-process there is no over-the-wire window.

It also reads RICHER signal than the wire ever exposed: the full ``result_json``
(the agent's own output + the verify-gate output), which the goal layer turns
into the grounded ``deliveries.md`` record the direction evaluator reads.

The :class:`GoalEngine` Protocol is what the goal tick depends on; tests inject a
fake.
