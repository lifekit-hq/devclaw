"""The direction evaluator — "is this goal going the right way?".

This is the layer the old shipped-PRs-vs-backlog "done" check could not be. That
check was shallow: a PR can be gate-green but wrong; the backlog can drift from
the real intent; *done* is not the same as *good*. Now that the evaluator (devclaw)
sits right next to the repo and the execution context, it judges direction from
GROUNDED ARTIFACTS — the agent's own output, the verify-gate verdicts, the PRs,
and (at the done-gate) a read-only review of the actual repo against done_when —
not from counting backlog items.

It runs as a SEPARATE, less-frequent cognition step from the next-action planner
(the mechanism/cognition split applied to evaluation itself): the cheap per-tick
progress check and per-delivery evidence capture cost ~0 tokens and gate when the
evaluator runs, so direction is judged periodically and at the moment of closing,
never on every tick.

The verdict drives the loop, it doesn't just report:
- ``achieved``    → the goal may close ``done`` (only path to done — the planner's
                    "done" is merely a proposal).
- ``off_track``   → ``corrections`` are written to inbox.md as steering; the
                    next-action planner picks them up and the goal keeps going.
- ``stalled``     → block + notify (thrash / repeated failure that won't self-fix).
- ``needs_human`` → block + notify with a specific question.
- ``on_track``    → record and continue.
