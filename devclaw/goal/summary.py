"""Plain-language summarizer — rewrite an owner-altitude notification into one or
two non-technical sentences.

This is cognition, but deliberately bounded so it can't threaten the quota:
  - it runs ONLY on OWNER-level notifications (see goal_tick.NotifyLevel) — the
    rare, owner-facing events (a blocker, a paused-for-review, a direction
    question, a verified completion), never per-task, never on the zero-token
    idle path;
  - it runs at a cheap tier (haiku by default);
  - it is best-effort — ANY failure (caller error, empty / runaway output)
    returns the original text, so a notification is never lost and a tick is
    never broken by the summarizer.

The outcome-goals split: mechanism decides WHEN to notify (the altitude gate in
goal_tick); cognition here writes WHAT it says.
