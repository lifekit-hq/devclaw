"""Delivery strategy — how a goal's task work maps onto git branches + PRs.

This NAMES a decision that already existed implicitly, smeared across the tick
and delivery layers as ad-hoc ``store.read_checklist(...)`` / ``f"goal/{id}"``
conditionals: a checklist-mode goal accumulates every item's commits on a shared
``goal/<id>`` branch (one cumulative PR per goal — Pillar 1); a legacy /
non-checklist goal delivers each action as its own branch + PR off the default
branch.

It is the seam a second topology (per-task PRs to main) plugs into later, instead
of threading a new conditional through every call site. TODAY it owns ONLY the
branch-selection decision — the one part that extracts with provably zero
behaviour change: ``Checklist`` is a plain frozen dataclass (always truthy, no
``__bool__``/``__len__``), so the pre-existing ``is not None`` vs. truthiness
split across the three call sites collapses to a single predicate.

Auto-merge eligibility (the tick still keys off ``bool(addresses)``) and the
scheduler dep-gate stay at their call sites on purpose: they carry latent
per-action-vs-per-goal signal mismatches that must be reconciled *deliberately*
in the PR that actually changes their behaviour — not laundered through a
"pure refactor".

Resolution mirrors :func:`devclaw.goal.merge.resolve_automerge`: a pure function
of goal state, trivially unit-testable.

      per-action strategy resets the workspace to ``origin/main`` before every

    still fails loud here rather than being silently downgraded to per-action. The
