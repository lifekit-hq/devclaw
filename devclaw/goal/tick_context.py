"""Shared tick primitives — the leaf of the goal-heartbeat module split.

Constants, the :class:`Outcome` / :class:`NotifyLevel` / :class:`Phase` enums,
:class:`TickContext`, the phase classifier, the per-goal tick lock, the notify
helpers, and the atomic-dispatch primitives. Everything here is imported by the
other ``tick_*`` modules and re-exported from :mod:`devclaw.goal.tick` so the
public surface (and every test import) is unchanged.

Preserving :class:`Outcome`'s identity HERE is load-bearing — ``service.py`` and

chain in ``_tick_goal_impl`` relies on it being a single class.

# BOTH ticks ran a full cognition round (a planner/evaluator call can take
# minutes) and the loser abandoned its ENTIRE planning round to a
# TransitionConflict — correct, but a wasted round of tokens and a confusing
# trace. This lock adds EFFICIENCY + LEGIBILITY on top of CAS's correctness:
# the second tick simply waits for the first to finish, then reads FRESH
# state — usually landing on IDLE at zero cognition cost instead of losing a
# race it already lost the moment it started.

# evaluate_goal stay lock-free on purpose. They are synchronous, loop-atomic
# MCP calls that must never wait behind a minutes-long cognition await; CAS

# "one per-goal asyncio.Lock around tick_goal only; steer/cancel stay sync +
