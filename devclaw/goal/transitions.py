"""The goal-state transition choke point — Tranche 1/PR4.

Before this PR every phase/lifecycle/in_flight change was a bespoke
``replace(status, phase=..., lifecycle=..., ...)`` + ``save_status`` call
scattered across ``tick.py`` / ``service.py``, with no
mechanism stopping two writers (a tick's planner await racing a concurrent
``steer_goal``/``cancel_goal``) from both reading the same snapshot and one
clobbering the other's write — the stale-snapshot un-cancel class. This module
is the enum + legality table :class:`~devclaw.goal.store.GoalStore.transition`
validates against; it is deliberately dependency-free (imports ``models``
only) so it can be unit-tested in complete isolation from the store/tick wiring.

:class:`State` is a STORED projection of today's ``GoalStatus`` fields
(``phase`` / ``lifecycle`` / ``in_flight``) — :func:`derive_state` computes it
the same way ``tick._classify`` always has, so the enum never becomes a second
source of truth to keep in sync by hand. :class:`Event` names the domain
action a handler is performing (not the field mutation) so the :data:`LEGAL`
table reads as "what can this goal DO from here", not "what fields changed".

#: sweep; formerly the per-tick `_readopt_orphaned_program`) re-adopting a
#: lost ref from a blocked goal.
