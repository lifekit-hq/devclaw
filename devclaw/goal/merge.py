"""Auto-merge on gate-green — the hands-off half of the outcome-goals design
(decision 2: "after a unit's PR passes its gate, devclaw merges it itself and
pings a plain summary; the done-gate is the safety net").

Default OFF: merging to the default branch unsupervised is consequential, so it
is the owner's switch to flip (DEVCLAW_GOAL_AUTOMERGE=1). When on, the goal layer
squash-merges a delivered task's PR once its verify gate passed, and tells the
owner in plain language. Best-effort — a merge failure leaves the PR open for
manual review and never breaks the tick.

The gh call lives here (not in goal_tick) so the tick stays a pure, subprocess-free
unit under test; goal_service binds the real merger, tests inject a fake.

Configuration lives in exactly two places, deliberately NOT in goal.yaml: the
devclaw-wide default (``DEVCLAW_GOAL_AUTOMERGE``, this module) and an optional
per-project override (``Project.automerge`` in :mod:`devclaw.project_registry`,
resolved by :func:`resolve_automerge`). A goal itself has no automerge field —
merging is an ops/deploy-scope decision the owner makes about a REPO, not
something a goal's own objective should carry (found 2026-07-05: a stray
``automerge: true`` hand-written into a goal.yaml did nothing at all, silently,
because nothing ever read it — the only real switch was the global env var).

    Prefers **GitHub-native auto-merge** (``gh pr merge --auto``): GitHub resolves
    mergeability and waits on the required check SERVER-SIDE, then merges. This
    kills the client-side mergeability race — a fresh PR reports ``mergeable:
    UNKNOWN`` for seconds after creation, and an immediate blind ``gh pr merge``
    fails on that, so the goal wrongly blocked "please merge" and stalled for
    hours (finance-sentry, 2026-07-17). With ``--auto`` a True return means the
    merge is *enabled/queued* (GitHub completes it) — the caller's tip re-check
    before the next task tolerates the eventual-merge delay.

    ORDER MATTERS (2026-07-18 finance-sentry diagnosis): ``--auto`` is enabled
    FIRST, while the PR is still blocked on the not-yet-posted required check —
    GitHub only accepts enabling auto-merge on a PR that has something left to
    wait for. Posting the gate status first can make the PR "clean", ``--auto``
    then errors ("clean status") and the merge degrades to the client-side
    direct attempt, which fires sub-second after PR creation while
    ``mergeStateStatus`` is still UNKNOWN and loses that race essentially
    always (every recent finance-sentry PR ended up owner-merged by hand).
    Enable-then-post lets GitHub resolve everything server-side — no client
    polling, no race.

    Falls back to a direct merge for repos where GitHub auto-merge isn't enabled
