"""Settle & recover in-flight work — the goal-tick polling resolvers.

Where dispatched work comes back: the atomic settle of a regular action (delivery
row + checklist update + auto-merge / program-stack reconcile), the discovery and
done-gate poll resolvers, the checklist-item settle computation, and the
once-per-service-start orphaned-ref sweep. This is the top of the tick_* import
graph — it consumes tick_dispatch (_resolve_discovery) and tick_donegate
(_resolve_done_gate) plus tick_guards + tick_context, and is re-exported from
tick.py (tick._tick_goal_impl chains through _resolve_polling_action).

    Formerly the per-tick ``_readopt_orphaned_program`` (2026-07-09
    incident); PR7 extends it to tasks and demotes it to a once-per-service-
    start sweep (see :func:`sweep_orphaned_refs`) — atomic dispatch means a
    ref can no longer be lost MID-FLIGHT, so a per-tick check is no longer
    load-bearing; a startup sweep still catches refs lost by an OLDER build,
    or a restart landing in the (now much narrower) commit-to-kick window.

    "Orphan" = the goal's most recent task/program by ``parent_goal_id``

    replacement for the old ``log_contains(f" {id} → ")`` string match) —
    running OR already-terminal both qualify; the normal POLLING_ACTION path
    then polls/settles it exactly as if the ref had never been lost.

    Checks the TASK finder first, then the PROGRAM finder: in a healthy

    theoretically does, task-first is a pragmatic simplification — comparing
    ``created_at`` precisely would need both finders to expose it, for a
    benefit that in practice never matters (the brief this PR implements
