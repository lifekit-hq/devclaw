"""The goal layer, wired — the folded-in goalclaw, now a subsystem of devclaw.

Owns the durable goals under ``DEVCLAW_GOALS_DIR``, drives them across a heartbeat
(a resident asyncio loop, woken either by the interval or — in-process — by a task
settling), and exposes the steer/observe surface the MCP tools wrap
(create/get/list/steer/evaluate). Dispatch is in-process via :class:`InProcessEngine`,
so there is no HTTP, no bearer token, and no ``/wake`` endpoint anymore.

Cognition (the planner + the evaluator) is injected; for the live service it
binds devclaw's ``claude --print`` callers at the goal-planner / evaluator tiers.
