"""Repo-scoped worker memory brief (mission-control borrow item 3).

Every new goal on the same repo used to relearn build quirks and test
gotchas from zero: a goal's own state dies with it, and the sandbox
workspace is ``git clean -fdx``-wiped per dispatch, so nothing a worker
left in-repo survived either. This module is the pure glue around the
host-side fix — a ``project_docs`` row keyed by normalized workspace path:

- workers hand back one-line ``REPO NOTES:`` facts (the runner's return
  contract parses them into ``result_json``);
- the settle path merges them into the repo's accumulated brief
  (:func:`merge_repo_notes` — plain line dedupe + a size cap, zero LLM);
- the dispatch path prepends the brief to the next worker's goal text
  (:func:`render_brief_prefix` — plain text injection, model-agnostic,
  no vendor hook wiring).

Everything here is pure computation; reads/writes live on the GoalStore
(``read_repo_brief`` / ``write_repo_brief``) and the calling tick modules.
