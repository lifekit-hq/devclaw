"""Status — the single-writer / CAS choke point.

:class:`GoalStatusMixin` carries every phase/lifecycle/in_flight write:
``load_status`` and its lazy STATUS.md migration, the CAS-guarded
:meth:`GoalStatusMixin.transition` (the choke point every production
transition routes through), the column-only ``update_status_fields`` fast
path, ``force_block`` (the illegal-transition escape hatch), and the STATUS.md
view renderer.

Split out of ``GoalStore`` as a mixin on the SAME instance — every method here
runs against the ``self._state`` / ``self._goal_state`` / ``self._now`` /
``self._pending_mirrors`` the base ``GoalStore`` owns, so the transaction /
single-writer / mirror-deferral semantics are byte-identical to the pre-split
monolith.

           match ``expect``'s (or the fresh defaults, when no row exists yet).
           A mismatch means another writer (steer_goal / cancel_goal / a
           parallel tick) committed between the caller's load and this call;
           raises :class:`~devclaw.goal.transitions.TransitionConflict` and
           writes NOTHING — the caller's decision was based on a snapshot
           that's no longer current, so honoring it would silently clobber
           whatever landed in between (the stale-snapshot un-cancel class this
           PR closes).
        2. **Legality** — ``event`` must permit landing on ``derive_state(new)``
           from the row's CURRENT state per
           :data:`~devclaw.goal.transitions.LEGAL`. A miss raises
           :class:`~devclaw.goal.transitions.IllegalTransition` — always a
           bug, never an expected race.

        Only past both does this write (same shape as save_status: phase_history
        append when phase changed, then write_status, then the STATUS.md view
        AFTER the transaction commits — or DEFERRED, when this call is itself
        nested inside a caller-opened ``transaction()`` (PR7's atomic dispatch/
        settle units): see :meth:`_flush_or_defer_status_view`). Returns the
        ACTUAL stored object (``new`` with ``state``/``version`` stamped) —
        callers MUST thread this forward instead of reusing their pre-call
        snapshot (see tick.py's "version threading rule").

        ``consume_steering`` (PR5): exact ``goal_steering`` row ids to mark
        consumed, INSIDE this same transaction, once past both guards. This
        is what makes "consume exactly the steering rows the planner just
        acted on" atomic with the decision write itself — a
        :class:`TransitionConflict`/:class:`IllegalTransition` raised above
        means this line never runs, so an abandoned tick's steering rides
        the rollback and stays unread (closes "steer-during-planner-await
        lost": the old model consumed by a count stamped AFTER the fact,
