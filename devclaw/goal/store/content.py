"""Content surfaces — everything the goal accretes that ISN'T the status row.

:class:`GoalContentMixin` carries the log, settlements, deliveries, checklist,
firmed-draft, discovery/spec, and inbox/steering surfaces — each row-first
(SQLite is the source of truth since Tranche 1/PR5–PR7) with the ``.md`` files
as generated / hand-append mirrors, plus the lazy one-shot migrations that seed
those rows from legacy on-disk files. :class:`GoalDocCorrupt` (the loud
fail-closed on a torn acceptance contract) lives here too.

Split out of ``GoalStore`` as a mixin on the SAME instance — every method here
runs against the ``self._state`` / ``self._goal_state`` / ``self._now`` /
``self._dir`` / ``self._pending_mirrors`` the base ``GoalStore`` owns, so the
row-first ordering, mirror-deferral, and lazy-ingest semantics are byte-identical
to the pre-split monolith.

        and hand-ingested rows consistent (both hold the inbox.md line
        verbatim); the structured ``source`` column exists separately for
        queries.

        Runs ``_ingest_inbox`` FIRST so any pre-existing hand-typed
        ``inbox.md`` lines get their own rows (and the ingest cursor catches
        up to them) BEFORE this call's own cursor math — otherwise a
        hand-typed line sitting between the old cursor and the file's end
        would be silently skipped once this call moves the cursor past it.

        Ordering — deliberately FILE-append first, THEN the rows+cursor
        commit: a crash in between leaves ``inbox.md`` with a line the rows
        don't know about yet, which the next ``_ingest_inbox`` call picks up
        as an ordinary hand-typed ``manual``-sourced row — the source label
        is wrong but nothing is LOST. The reverse order (rows first) risks
        the opposite: a crash after the row+cursor commit but before the
        file write leaves the cursor ahead of the file, and if the retried
        file write never lands with the exact same content, that text can
        end up permanently below the (already-advanced) cursor — a genuine
        loss. Losing steering is worse than a rare re-sourced duplicate, so
        file-first wins.
