"""Tranche 1 substrate — the SQLite home for goal state.

Goal state used to be spread across per-goal files under ``DEVCLAW_GOALS_DIR``
(``goal.yaml`` / ``STATUS.md`` / ``log.md`` / ``inbox.md`` / ``deliveries.md`` …)
and linked to the task queue only by a string goal id. The approved Tranche 1
plan consolidates that state into the SAME ``devclaw.db`` SQLite database that
:class:`devclaw.state_store.StateStore` already owns (WAL, one shared
connection guarded by a single ``threading.RLock``), so a task row and its
owning goal's state can be written in one atomic :meth:`StateStore.transaction`.

**PR3 brought ``goal_status`` + ``goal_phase_history`` LIVE.** ``GoalState``
now owns the status read/write surface (:meth:`read_status` /
:meth:`write_status` / the phase-history methods); ``GoalStore.load_status`` /
``save_status`` are re-backed onto it, with ``STATUS.md`` demoted to a
generated full-fidelity view (the rollback path).

**PR5 brought ``goal_steering`` LIVE.** ``consumed_at IS NULL`` is now the
source of truth for "unread" — ``GoalStore.append_steering`` /
``_ingest_inbox`` write rows, ``GoalStore.transition(consume_steering=...)``
consumes them by exact id. ``inbox.md`` stays both the human-readable mirror
and a hand-append input (lazily ingested into rows).

**PR6 brought ``goal_log`` / ``goal_deliveries`` / ``goal_docs`` LIVE.**
``goal_log`` and ``goal_deliveries`` are row-backed with ``log.md`` /
``deliveries.md`` as generated mirrors (lazily migrated, same shape as
PR3/PR5); ``goal_deliveries`` also gained idempotent inserts keyed on a
nullable ``ref_id`` (``UNIQUE(goal_id, ref_id)`` + INSERT OR IGNORE), closing
a PR4-review nuance where a settle landing in a ``TransitionConflict`` retry
window could append the same delivery twice. ``goal_docs`` now backs
``checklist.yaml`` / ``firmed-draft.yaml`` (kinds ``checklist`` /
``firmed_draft``) — the torn-write class T0.4 hardened the file view against
(``tmp`` + ``os.replace``) becomes structurally impossible once a goal has a
row, courtesy of SQLite's atomic upsert. ``goal_settlements`` stays
created-but-empty until a later PR migrates onto it.
