"""Chef-side goal admission — "verified on all sides" before the chef accepts.

Today `create_goal` is best-effort: it warns on dubious shape (bare verify_cmd)
but accepts every goal regardless. That makes the waiter (or any caller) the
only line of defense against malformed orders. The chef has no standards.

This module is the standards. `verify_goal` runs structural checks against a
goal's parameters and returns a list of `AdmissionCondition`s with severity
``reject`` or ``warn``. `create_goal` consumes the result: any ``reject``
becomes a structured rejection (caller must fix and re-file); ``warn`` items
flow through to the result dict as before.

Why machine-readable codes (not just prose): the waiter (or any upstream chain
link) needs to ROUTE on the rejection — e.g. an `undecomposable_done_when`
rejection should loop back to the grill, while `missing_domain_research` should
trigger the domain-research module once it exists. Free-text doesn't route.

v1 scope (deliberately tight):
- Hard mechanical checks only. No LLM cognition.
- The set of codes is small. Add new ones when a real gap surfaces in the
  chain test or in production, not speculatively.
- `missing_domain_research_*` is deferred until the domain-research module
  exists (no point rejecting on something that can't be produced).

Spec 012 US2 widened the standards from "is this goal well-shaped?" to "was
this saga AUTHORED?": three named slots (``out_of_scope`` / ``invariants`` /
``established``) join objective and done_when, and an unfilled one is rejected
here, naming it, rather than surfacing to a worker mid-run (FR-008). Still hard
mechanical checks only — presence, not quality.

See ~/memory/projects/devclaw/chain-map-2026-06-30.md row 18 for the design
context and the gaps this closes.
