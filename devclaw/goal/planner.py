"""The next-action planner — the goal layer's first cognition call.

Folded in from goalclaw. Fired ONLY when the cheap check found real work. Same
mechanism/cognition split as devclaw's DAG planner: Claude decides, Python
validates the JSON. It decides the *next action* toward a goal — it does NOT
decompose code (that's start_program) and it does NOT judge direction (that's
goal_evaluator). Light reasoning → the sonnet tier by default.

Cognition reuses devclaw's own ``claude --print`` caller (``planner.claude_with_model``)
rather than the Agent SDK goalclaw used standalone: one cognition mechanism for
the whole service, no extra dependency, and it bills the Pro/Max OAuth session
directly — which (from 2026-06-15) draws from a different pool than the Agent SDK,
so ``--print`` is also the safer quota choice for a recurring loop.
