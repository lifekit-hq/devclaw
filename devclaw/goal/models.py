"""Goal-layer domain types — the durable mind, as plain data.

Folded in from goalclaw. A :class:`Goal` is the durable objective (read from
``goal.yaml``); a :class:`GoalStatus` is the mutable point-in-time state
(``STATUS.md`` frontmatter), overwritten each tick. An :class:`Action` is a
single engine call the planner decided on; a :class:`PlanResult` is the whole
next-action decision. :class:`EvalResult` is the direction evaluator's verdict —
the layer that asks "is this going the right way?" not just "did it ship?".

These are deliberately separate from the task/program types in
``state_store.py``: a ``program`` is a bounded, one-shot DAG that runs to
completion; a ``goal`` is an open-ended standing intent advanced across days via
the heartbeat + steering. Different time-scales, different lifecycles — the goal
layer sits *above* the program/task engine and dispatches into it.
