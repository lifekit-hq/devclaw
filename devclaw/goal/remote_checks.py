"""Grounded remote-checks verification — "is the target repo's REAL CI green?".

The 2026-07-06 quarterly benchmark (closeloop-bench-2026-07-05) closed a goal
whose GitHub Actions had failed at startup on all 32 runs: the sandbox verify
gate passed, the internal log said "gate=passed", and nothing in the chain ever
looked at the repo's actual check surface. Silence read as success.

This module is the look. At the done-gate, when the goal's work lives on a
shared goal branch with a PR, devclaw queries the REAL check state for that
branch's head commit — both the check-runs API (any CI provider) and the
Actions runs API (which is where `startup_failure` runs appear even when the
check-runs list is empty, exactly the benchmark's failure signature) — and an
``achieved`` verdict is only honored when the remote checks don't contradict it.

Verdict semantics (deliberately fail-open on *infrastructure* uncertainty,
fail-closed on *evidence* of a problem):

- ``passing``      → close as normal.
- ``failing``      → block the close; the corrections steer a fix.
- ``pending``      → block the close; re-propose once the runs settle.
- ``infra_broken`` → every bad run is a ``startup_failure`` — CI infrastructure
                     never executed a single step (billing lock on a private
                     repo, disabled Actions), so the runs say nothing about the
                     code. Blocks only under ``strict`` ci-gate; under
                     ``flexible`` (the default) the close is honored on the
                     internal verify gate alone, loudly annotated.
- ``none``         → workflows exist but produced zero runs/checks for this
                     commit — the benchmark's "CI never ran and nobody noticed"
                     case. Same infra-shaped signature: blocks only under
                     ``strict``.
- ``no_workflows`` → the repo has no ``.github/workflows`` — nothing to check;
                     does not block (authoring CI is the checklist's job, per
                     plan.md §Production-ready C5, not the gate's).
- ``unknown``      → gh/network error or a non-GitHub remote — logged loudly,
                     does not block (an infra flake must not wedge a verified
                     goal; the log line keeps it observable).

``DEVCLAW_GOAL_CI_GATE`` selects the stance: ``flexible`` (default — broken CI
infrastructure degrades to the internal verify gate instead of wedging the
goal) or ``strict`` (any non-green remote state blocks, the pre-2026-07-09
behavior). Test *failures* always block in both modes.

The gh calls live here (not in goal_tick) so the tick stays a pure,
subprocess-free unit under test; goal_service binds the real checker, tests
inject a fake — the same seam shape as ``merge.py``.
