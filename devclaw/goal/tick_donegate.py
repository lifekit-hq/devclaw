    proposes done. The reviewer's report is then fed to the direction evaluator
    — both sides speak the same vocabulary: ``done_when`` is decomposed into
    atomic clauses, and each clause needs SPECIFIC repo evidence (file path +
    symbol + test name) to count as satisfied. This closes the
    `finance-sentry-mcp-readonly` failure mode (2026-06-25), where the reviewer
    produced a vague prose report, the evaluator stamped it `achieved`, and the
    delivered PR turned out to be 16 stub tools with zero real backend reads.

    Two axes — both load-bearing for the verdict:
      1. PER-CLAUSE EVIDENCE — does the code DO what the goal asked?
      2. STRUCTURAL HEALTH   — is the code Denys would HAND TO A NEW HIRE? (added
                               2026-06-29 after closeloop's App.tsx grew to 1827

                               but left the codebase worse.)

    a poor Structural section is OFF_TRACK — the agent must come back and clean
    up before the goal closes."""
