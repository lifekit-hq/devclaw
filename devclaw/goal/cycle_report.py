"""The cycle-window close report — the mechanical, ZERO-LLM edge (ADR 0006
decision 3).

When the per-cycle run window (22:00–05:00 Europe/London by default) closes, the
*scheduled-edge owner* — today the goal heartbeat — assembles the cycle's slice
from rows devclaw already writes (``eval_outcomes``, the ``problems`` catalog)
and pushes a human-readable report through the existing notifier. It answers the
operator's real done-criterion: "kick off a goal for the cycle and it runs
without me." A cycle is **clean** iff **zero mechanism-wedges** fired in the
window — *and only counts at all if the loop actually ran that cycle* (see
**idle** below).

Clean-cycle boundary (LOCKED, ADR 0006 §5-O1):

- **wedge** (fails the cycle) = ``mechanical:*`` blocks, cognition-timeout-
  treated-as-terminal, and engine/gate **crash** classes (an engine error, a
  review-gate crash, a no-result-line worker, a wall-clock timeout, a broken
  delivery). These are the loop's own plumbing breaking.
- **clean** = a genuine ``needs_answer`` (human-gated is the design — surfaced
  so the operator knows to answer, but it does NOT fail the cycle) and a
  **self-healed quota/auth pause** (the pause machinery working unattended IS
  the mechanism working — listed in ``pauses`` so the operator sees it, never a
  wedge). A gate *verdict* (review requested changes, verify/test-integrity/
  browser gate failed closed on genuinely bad code) is the gate doing its job —
  a quality signal, not a mechanism wedge.
- **idle** (counts as NEITHER clean nor wedged) = a cycle in which the loop did
  no work at all: zero tasks settled AND zero wedges AND zero self-healed pauses
  AND zero needs-operator surfacings. This is what an *off* devclaw looks like —
  the instance paused/held or every goal cancelled for the window, so the
  heartbeat still fires the mechanical report but finds an empty slice. An idle
  cycle has nothing to be "clean" about (the done-criterion is vacuous when
  there was no goal to run), so it is EXCLUDED from the clean-cycle rate rather
  than silently counted as a success. Without this, an off week of empty nights
  drifts the rate upward toward a meaningless 100%. Conservative by design: a
  cycle where a goal genuinely worked but nothing *settled* before the window
  closed reads as idle and is dropped — that only ever under-counts, never
  inflates.

Everything here is arithmetic over existing rows: no LLM call, no subprocess.
The window math is pure functions over primitives so it is unit-testable without
a DB or a live clock (mirrors ``dispatch_gate``).
