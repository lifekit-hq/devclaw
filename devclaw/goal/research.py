"""The ``investigating`` lifecycle phase — research before proposing anything.

A senior dev handed an outcome ("make the dashboard usable") checks two things
before writing code: what the repo does *today*, and what *good* looks like for
this kind of thing. This module is the second half — given the objective and a
read-only analysis of the current repo, it synthesizes a **discovery brief**:

  - **Current state** — what the repo does now (grounded in the repo analysis).
  - **Gap to good** — where it falls short of the outcome.
  - **Best-practice checklist** — what a good <thing> covers, so the planner and
    evaluator have a concrete bar to align against.

Cognition only; the read-only repo analysis it consumes is dispatched by the
engine (review_repository) and polled by the tick — this module just turns that
analysis + the objective into the brief. Injected ``ClaudeCaller`` so tests stub
the LLM.
