"""Self-triage — the propose-only interceptor on the owner-ping path (slice 1).

Denys is the sole diagnostician: every owner ping lands on him and only he can
resolve it. This layer-3 cognition step sits BEFORE an eligible raw owner ping
goes out and turns "there is a problem" into "here is the problem, a proposed
fix, and how to approve it" — the owner becomes an APPROVER, not an author.

Same mechanism/cognition split as the planner/evaluator: Claude drafts, Python
validates the JSON. It (a) dedupes the problem against the deduplicated
``problems`` catalog and (b) drafts ONE concrete proposed resolution. It is
**propose-only** — it never writes state, never notifies, and never auto-acts;
layer 2 (:mod:`devclaw.goal.tick_context`) owns delivery.

Fail toward the owner: :func:`triage` NEVER raises. Any LLM/parse failure
returns ``None`` so the caller falls back to delivering the original raw ping
unchanged (loud, not silent) — the same best-effort contract as the owner
summarizer. The interceptor only ever runs on a REAL problem (an alert that
actually fired), never on an idle tick, so the zero-token idle guard is intact.

Slice 1 wires exactly one trigger — the DB-size alarm (#271); the seam is
general so a future ``needs_answer`` wire is one allowlist entry away.
