"""Action & investigation dispatch — the goal-tick engine-launch paths.

Everything that hands work to the engine (or resolves the discovery/decompose
step that precedes execution): the dispatch-cap backstop + atomic action
dispatch, the checklist in-flight flagging, the phase-handler shim, and the
investigating-phase paths (repo-research vs. from-scratch world-research, then
discovery synthesis + decomposition). Split out of :mod:`devclaw.goal.tick`;
imports tick_context + tick_guards, and is called by tick_settle /
