"""Self-issue-filing — Stage 1: FILE + CLOSE (the self-improving cycle's safe half).

Proposal: ``docs/proposals/self-issue-filing.md`` (Stage 1 LOCKED 2026-07-22).

At run-cycle close — the same mechanical, ZERO-LLM edge that assembles the cycle
report — devclaw turns its OWN recurring failures into GitHub issues on its own
repo, and retires them so they don't accumulate:

- **FILE** — a problem that has survived across ``>= N`` distinct run-cycles and
  has produced at least one *terminal* failure (not a self-healed block) gets a
  labelled issue on the devclaw repo. One issue per problem fingerprint
  (idempotent); a problem that recurs after its issue was closed reopens it.
- **CLOSE (anti-accumulation)** — an open self-filed issue whose problem has gone
  quiet (not seen for ``K`` cycle-spans) is auto-closed as stale. The two exits
  (fixed → recurrence stops; aged-out → quiet) keep the board honest.

Design mirrors ``cycle_report.py``: the decisions are **pure functions over
primitives** (unit-testable with no DB, no clock, no network); the DB reads/writes
ride the store's single writer; the GitHub calls sit behind an injectable ``gh``
adapter so tests never shell out. This is Stage 1 only — it never edits code and
never merges anything (that is Stage 2, and §3 of the proposal is reopened). So
there is no self-modification here, and no cognition call: it is pure wiring.
