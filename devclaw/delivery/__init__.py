"""Deliver a completed task's change as a reviewable branch + PR.

After a task settles ``done`` (the verify gate passed), the agent's change is
sitting **uncommitted** in the workspace. Delivery turns that into something you
*review* instead of *produce*: a branch, a commit, a push, and — if the remote
is GitHub and ``gh`` is authed — a pull request whose URL is recorded on the task.

Design:
  * **Best-effort + non-fatal.** A delivery failure never un-does a ``done`` task;
    it records what it managed (``branch`` / ``pushed`` / ``pr_url`` / ``error``).
  * **Graceful degradation.** Not a git repo, or no changes, or no remote, or no
    auth → it does as much as it can (often: commit to a local branch) and stops.
  * **Auth** is a GitHub token (``GITHUB_TOKEN`` / ``GH_TOKEN``) or ``gh``'s own
    login — this is *repo push access*, separate from the Claude OAuth pillar
    (which is about cognition billing, not git).
