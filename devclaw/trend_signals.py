"""Trend detection signals — cross-session pattern detectors.

The mechanism half of the trend-detection discipline (designed 2026-06-29). Each
signal is a deterministic Python check that runs every heartbeat and may fire a
trend observation. Signals are intentionally cheap and read-only: the cognition
half (the LLM retrospective pass that writes the trends.md entry) is gated
behind a fired signal, so quiet projects cost zero tokens.

This module is the place to add a new signal. Each signal is a subclass of
:class:`Signal` with a class-level ``id`` / ``category`` / ``scope`` and a
single ``check(ctx)`` method that returns a :class:`SignalResult`. Substrate
reads live INLINE in the signal — no separate substrate adapters until enough
signals share SQL to justify the dedup.

Boundary rules (carried from the thesis — do not violate inside ``check``):
  * NEVER call any goal-store write method (no ``append_steering``,
    ``write_checklist``, etc.). The detector observes; humans encode.
  * NEVER create tasks, alter ``done_when``, or edit ``AGENTS.md``.
  * Substrate reads only — git plumbing, ``GoalStore._inbox_lines`` (read), the
    sqlite ``tasks`` / ``traces`` tables (read). If a future signal looks like
    it needs a write, that's a design-bug — escalate, don't smuggle it in.
