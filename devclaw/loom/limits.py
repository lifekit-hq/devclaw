"""Classify an agent/planner failure so a usage-limit is never mistaken for a bug.

The load-bearing distinction: a model **usage/rate limit** must NOT be treated like
a code failure. Today a quota hit surfaces as a generic error → the queue retries
immediately → it burns the remaining quota on the same doomed call → the task fails
and the goal blocks. Instead we classify the failure text and let the caller PAUSE
on a limit and resume when it resets, while real failures still fail and transient
blips back off briefly.

Kinds:
  - RATE_LIMIT  short-term cap (per-minute / 5-hour) — pause, resume on reset
  - QUOTA       longer cap (weekly / "usage limit reached") — pause, resume on reset
  - AUTH        expired/broken login — pause + actionable owner ping, re-probe
  - TRANSIENT   overloaded / 5xx / network blip — short backoff, then retry
  - REAL        genuine code/agent failure — fail (with feedback), don't wait

Auth failures (401 / "failed to authenticate" / an expired OAuth session) used to
be REAL ("surface, don't pause") — the 2026-07-20 unattended night proved that
wrong: an expired VPS login "surfaced" as ~58 terminal cognition failures across
the whole run window with no pause and no owner ping, every call doomed until a
human re-login. AUTH is now a pausing kind like QUOTA — one account-wide pause
gates queue + heartbeat — but with its own fixed re-probe backoff
(:data:`AUTH_PAUSE_S`, no reset time exists to parse) and an ACTIONABLE ping
(the goal layer words it as "re-login needed", not "usage limit"). Waiting still
doesn't fix auth; pausing stops the doomed-call burn while the ping gets the
human, and the re-probe auto-resumes work after the re-login with no extra verb.

Pure + deterministic (no I/O, no hidden clock) so it's trivially unit-tested
against real error strings. ``retry_after_s`` is parsed from the text when the
provider states a reset hint; otherwise None and the caller applies a default
backoff. Absolute reset TIMES ("resets 10pm (UTC)") need a clock, so they are
parsed only when the caller injects ``now_utc`` — the module stays pure.

# --- patterns (checked in priority order; first hit wins) --------------------
# NB: a vendored subset of these patterns (AUTH/QUOTA/RATE + the relative
# retry-after parser) lives in runner/runner.py — the in-sandbox
# runner can't import devclaw, so it carries its own copy to emit a structured
# status="rate_limited" result. Keep the two in sync when editing.
# AUTH first: harness-shaped auth wording must classify as AUTH even when the
# text also mentions a rate-limit-shaped code — an expired login is never a
# quota event. "authentication required" is the ACP/worker wording from the
# 2026-07-20 night incident ("Conversation run failed …: Authentication
# required"); the planner-side wording that night ("Failed to authenticate:
# OAuth session expired and could not be refreshed") already matched.
# STRONG vs WEAK split (invariant-guard find, 2026-07-21): now that AUTH
# pauses the whole account, a bare "401"/"Unauthorized" in gate/review
# feedback about the app under development ("expected 200 got 401", "the
# /admin endpoint returns 401 for logged-in users") must NOT trigger a 2h
# pause + a false re-login ping. Only STRONG (harness-shaped) wording is AUTH;
# WEAK matches stay REAL — still checked before quota/rate so a 401 with
# rate-limit words nearby is never misrouted onto the pause-with-reset path.
# NB: the vendored runner.py copy (_LIMIT_AUTH) keeps the strong∪weak UNION —
# its only job is shielding auth text from the rate_limited tag; the host
# re-classifies from the original wording.

# keep it safe: (1) only a NEGATIVE code (``-\d+``) matches, so a clean ``exited
# 1`` bug stays REAL; (2) AUTH/QUOTA/RATE are checked BEFORE TRANSIENT in
# classify_failure, and a usage/auth crash always comes back as a *clean* nonzero
