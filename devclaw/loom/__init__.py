"""loom — the reusable orchestration core, sans the ``-claw`` prefix.

This package is the **extraction seam**: the engine-agnostic substrate devclaw is
built on, grouped under a neutral name so it can eventually become a standalone,
reusable library (an orchestrator weaving many threads — goals, tasks, agents —
into delivered work). devclaw remains the concrete product (the MCP server, the
sandbox engine, the GitHub delivery); loom is the part with no opinion about
*which* engine or product uses it.

What lives here (physically, all of it pure stdlib): :mod:`~devclaw.loom.limits`
(the usage-limit/rate-limit failure classifier), :mod:`~devclaw.loom.test_integrity`
(the gate's deleted/weakened-test guard), and :mod:`~devclaw.loom.trace` (the
run-trace capture). Old import paths (``devclaw.limits`` etc.) keep working via
thin shims, so this extraction is reversible and non-breaking.

loom is a LEAF by contract (pinned by ``tests/test_llm_call_leaf.py``): it
imports nothing from the rest of devclaw. The goal domain types + store used to
be re-exported here as a "curated surface", which made importing ``loom.trace``
execute this facade and drag ``goal`` + ``state_store`` behind every consumer —
the exact cycle the extraction seam exists to prevent. Import those from
``devclaw.goal`` directly; import the core from one place::
