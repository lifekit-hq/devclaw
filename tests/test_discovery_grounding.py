"""Discovery synthesis is grounded in the ACTUAL goal workspace (triage F4,
2026-07-13 — sibling of PR #227's wrong-codebase review bug).

On a failed/empty repo review, the discovery-synthesis prompt used to carry
NOTHING but the placeholder "review failed (no analysis captured)" — and
host-side claude, which inherits devclaw's own cwd, filled the gap with the
WRONG repo: the invented brief persisted to discovery.md and misdirected the
whole goal. These tests pin the fix: a mechanically-collected REPOSITORY
CONTEXT snapshot from ``goal.workspace_dir`` now rides into the prompt
(best-effort, never fatal), together with the anti-inference honesty rules.
