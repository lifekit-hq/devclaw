"""Tranche 1 / PR6 — log.md / deliveries.md move onto ``goal_log`` /
``goal_deliveries`` rows, with the files as generated mirrors (same pattern
PR3's STATUS.md and PR5's steering rows use).
``append_delivery`` gains a nullable ``ref_id`` idempotency key —
``UNIQUE(goal_id, ref_id)`` + INSERT OR IGNORE — closing a PR4-review nuance:
a ``TransitionConflict`` landing in the settle-retry window could make the
tick's retry append the SAME delivery twice.

Named regression tests, each with a one-line comment naming the failure class
it closes. See ``devclaw/goal/store.py`` (log/deliveries sections),
``devclaw/goal/state.py`` (the ``goal_log`` / ``goal_deliveries`` row
surface), and ``devclaw/goal/tick.py``'s ``_resolve_polling_action`` (the
``ref_id=ref.id`` call-site fix). The checklist/firmed-draft ``goal_docs``
round-trips this module used to cover were amputated with host cognition
(spec 008 shrink)."""
