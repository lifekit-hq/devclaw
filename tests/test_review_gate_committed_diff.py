"""Regression: the post-gate diff must include work the agent COMMITTED.

The commit coda asks the engineer to commit its work, and in goal-branch mode
those commits land directly on ``goal/<id>`` — by settle time the tree can be
clean. The gates (test-integrity scan + adversarial review) used to judge only
``git diff`` + ``git diff --cached``, so a fully-committed change reviewed as a
no-op and was sent back with "requested changes" (live-found 2026-07-11: three
closeloop-bench tasks in a row rejected on a diff of trend-file noise while the
real work sat committed on the goal branch).

These tests use REAL git repos (no fake-diff autouse fixture here on purpose)
to pin the contract end to end: pre-run HEAD is the diff baseline.
