"""The quality gate is a self-contained package — boundary pinned.

Everything the gate needs to render a verdict (logic, prompts, loader) lives
under devclaw/quality/; its only internal deps are deliberate leaf modules
(llm_call, model_tiers, loom, cognition's bind seam). These pin the boundary
so a future extraction to its own repo stays a directory move, and so the
prompt relocation (devclaw/prompts/ → devclaw/quality/prompts/, 2026-07-19)
can't silently regress.
