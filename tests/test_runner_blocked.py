"""In-sandbox honest-exit — the structured ``status="blocked"`` self-report.

The task prompt already instructs the engineer to end its final hand-back with
``STATUS: DONE`` or ``BLOCKED: <reason>`` when it genuinely cannot finish, but
that string used to ride invisibly inside ``agent_output`` and never touched the
done/failed decision — so a truly-stuck agent either fabricated a plausible
result or failed generically and got retried pointlessly. The runner now parses
its OWN final message for that self-report and promotes it to a first-class
terminal ``status="blocked"`` (+ ``reason``). These pin the parser and prove the
prompt-echo can't false-positive (the parse reads the agent message, not the
captured decorative stdout that echoes the literal contract text).
