"""MCP ``start_program`` as sugar for ``create_goal(mode='one_shot')`` —
ADR 0003 stage 2b (the surface collapse).

The tool no longer submits a raw queue program: it files a ONE-SHOT GOAL —
same intake spine, checklist-as-one-parallel-program execution, PR-per-slice
delivery, grounded done-gate close — and returns the goal_id. The brief rides
as the goal's SPEC (the scope contract firming derives done_when from), which
is what keeps admission parity with the old direct-queue path: a substantial
brief plans; nothing new is demanded of the caller.
