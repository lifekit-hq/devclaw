"""Tranche 1 / PR8 — the per-goal ``asyncio.Lock`` around ``tick_goal``.

CAS (``GoalStore.transition``'s optimistic-concurrency check, Tranche 1/PR4)
already guarantees CORRECTNESS when two ticks race the SAME goal — the ONLY
same-goal concurrency left standing after PR4 is an MCP-driven ``tick_one``
(manual poke, ops-agent) overlapping the heartbeat's ``tick_all`` sweep for
that goal. Pre-PR8, that race meant BOTH ticks ran a full cognition round (a
planner/evaluator call can take minutes) and the LOSER abandoned its entire
planning round to a ``TransitionConflict`` — correct, but wasteful and a
confusing trace. PR8's lock adds EFFICIENCY + LEGIBILITY on top of CAS: the
second tick simply waits for the first to finish, then reads FRESH state.

Named regression tests, each with a one-line comment naming the property it
proves. See ``devclaw/goal/tick.py``'s ``_TICK_LOCKS`` / ``_tick_lock`` /
``tick_goal`` (the lock's own comment has the full rationale, including WHY
``steer_goal`` / ``cancel_goal`` / ``evaluate_goal`` stay lock-free).
