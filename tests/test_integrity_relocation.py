"""Regression tests for the test-integrity RELOCATION CREDIT (2026-07-17).

A pure-deletion PR that removes a test file whose methods a PRIOR merged PR
already ported into another file shows N removals / 0 additions in its own diff
— which the count alone reads as a weakening. That mislabelling cost
closeloop-bench ~40h of thrash. These assert the gate now CREDITS a removed test
whose name is proven to still exist elsewhere in the post-change tree, while a
genuine deletion (no equivalent) stays flagged — grounded relaxation, fail
closed on no evidence.
