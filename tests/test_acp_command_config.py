"""The ACP agent command is a configurable seam, not a hardcode.

The worker layer's model-agnosticism claim used to rest on a literal
``acp_command=["claude-agent-acp"]`` inside the runner — swapping the agent
meant editing code. Now the command is resolved payload → env → default, and
the host threads it through the runner JSON payload exactly like ``model``
(host env vars do NOT cross the container boundary, so a payload ride is the
only channel that works in the sandbox). These pin that seam.

The runner lives at runner/runner.py (not a package); its
runner is stdlib-only since spec 011, so a top-level import is dependency-free.
