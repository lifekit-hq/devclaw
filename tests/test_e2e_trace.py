"""E2E trace harness — stub mode.

Runs a full goal lifecycle (investigating → executing → done-gate → done) with
fakes for everything network-touching, while a real :class:`Tracer` collects
every observable event. The assertion is structural: the trace must show the
expected sequence of ticks, dispatches, deliveries, and notifications. This is
the safety net for refactors that touch the runtime path — if a refactor breaks
the live flow it will break this trace shape, not just unit tests.
