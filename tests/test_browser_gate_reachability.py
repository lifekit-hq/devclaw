"""Regression tests for the browser-gate reachability escape valve.

The browser-E2E gate fires MECHANICALLY on any frontend file. Its one legitimate
false positive is a UI change not rendered in the running app (a library component
no route imports yet — the cmn-tab-group wedge, 2026-07-17). This escape valve
lets an INDEPENDENT, grounded judge relax that block — but ONLY on an affirmative,
proven "not reachable"; every other outcome (reachable / unknown / a real browser
failure / a judge crash / disabled) leaves the fail-closed block standing.

Two halves, mirroring the review gate:
  1. the pure module (devclaw/quality/reachability.py): prompt build, verdict
     normalization, JSON parse.
  2. the queue integration (_browser_reachability_clears + settle): only ever
     downgrades a NO-RUN block, never a real failure; fails closed on any doubt;
     no cognition on idle/backend/passing paths (the zero-token guard).

Driven with a stubbed judge — no docker, no claude.
