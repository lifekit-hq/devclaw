"""Content-integrity tests for the baked worker skills (``runner/skills/``).

The curation rules for anything a worker reads at task time, mechanically
enforced (these are the model-agnostic invariants from CLAUDE.md/README):

  - every skill is a plain-markdown file with an H1 title
  - no YAML frontmatter, no slash-command references (model-agnostic invariant)
  - no "ask the user" phrasing (workers are unattended; decisions derive from
    the task contract or fail loudly)

Formerly ``test_skill_library_content.py``, which also covered the curated
host-side ``skill-library/`` tier — that tier was removed 2026-07-13 (inert in
production: nothing populated ``Goal.skills_required`` and no deploy step
populated the host path). The baked tier is the one worker-facing standard now.
