"""Pre-PR adversarial diff-review gate — the layer that READS the code.

Two halves:
  1. the pure module (devclaw/review_gate.py): prompt build, verdict validation +
     verdict/issue reconciliation, feedback formatting, JSON parsing.
  2. the queue integration: a request_changes verdict feeds back through the SAME
     retry loop as a gate failure; approve ships; the gate fails OPEN.

Driven with stub runners + a stub reviewer (no docker, no claude).
