"""From-scratch goals fire world-research at investigation open-time.

The investigating phase has two branches: world-research when the goal is
from-scratch (no ``repo_url``), repo-research otherwise. These tests cover
the from-scratch branch end-to-end through ``tick_goal``.

Cognition-quality grading of the brief itself lives in tests/chain/.
