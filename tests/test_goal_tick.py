# PR7 demoted the per-tick reconcile (which lived HERE, inside tick_goal) to
# a once-per-service-start sweep (sweep_orphaned_refs) — atomic dispatch
# makes losing a ref mid-flight structurally impossible on THIS build going
# forward, so a per-tick check is no longer load-bearing; the sweep still
# catches a ref lost by an older build or something outside the dispatch
# path. These three tests are MECHANICALLY re-pointed at the sweep: same
# scenarios, same assertions, split across an explicit sweep_orphaned_refs()
# call (what used to happen silently inside the one tick_goal call) followed
# by an ordinary tick (which now finds the ref already restored and proceeds
# exactly as it always has for an in-flight action).
