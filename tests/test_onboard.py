"""Onboarding tests — generate a DRAFT doc set on first touch of a repo.

`onboard` is a task kind that mirrors the `review_repository` read-only path
but is allowed to write FOUR docs (AGENTS.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md,
DECISIONS.md) so both agent + human have onboarding infrastructure. C6 in
plan.md §Production-ready: a project with only AGENTS.md is undocumented from
a human's point of view. The draft is human-reviewed (not authoritative until
then), so when a doc already exists the agent validates-and-keeps rather than
clobbering.

Two layers, both SDK-/docker-/claude-free: the goal-wrapper prompt (runner) and
the TaskQueue wiring (a stub engine stands in for OpenHands).
