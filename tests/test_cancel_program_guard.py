"""MCP ``cancel_program`` guards goal-owned programs — the ADR 0003 hierarchy.

``cancel_goal`` cascades DOWN to its child program (``service.cancel_goal`` →
``queue.cancel_program``). But cancelling a goal-owned program DIRECTLY does not
cascade UP: it would kill the program and leave the owning goal executing,
desynced from its dead program (the tick then reconciles a loss it never chose).
So the tool now REJECTS a program with a ``parent_goal_id`` and redirects to
``cancel_goal``. Standalone programs (``parent_goal_id is None`` — legacy raw
``start_program`` builds) still cancel normally, so back-compat is preserved.
