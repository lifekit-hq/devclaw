"""Regression tests for the browser-E2E verification gate's pure verdict layer
(``devclaw/quality/browser_gate.py``).

The gap under test (2026-07-17): a UI change that passes ``ng build && vitest``
+ a static diff review but was never rendered in a browser ships broken. These
assert the verdict folds (browser_report, diff, config_present) into a
fail-closed decision — and, critically, that an exit-0 run which executed NOTHING
is ``never_ran``, not a pass (the existence-vs-execution scar).
