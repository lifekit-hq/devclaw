"""Unit tests for ``FirmingHandler`` — the first PhaseHandler.

Two state-machine paths matter:

  * round 1 → all-answered draft → lifecycle transitions to ``executing``,
    ADVANCED outcome
  * round 1 → draft with unknowns → ``phase=blocked``, BLOCKED outcome, owner
    ping sent

Plus round-N via ``handle_answer`` (the MCP entry point): merge prior + answers,
re-firm, same two terminal states. The cognition caller is faked — these are
state-machine tests, not LLM tests."""
