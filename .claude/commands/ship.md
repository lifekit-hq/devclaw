Ship the working tree as a PR, in this exact order — stop at the first failure
and report it instead of proceeding:

1. **Branch check.** If the branch above is `main`/`master`, STOP: create a
   worktree + branch first (.claude/rules/git-workflow.md). Never ship from main.
2. **Import-path sanity** (worktrees): `.venv/bin/python -c "import devclaw; print(devclaw.__file__)"`
   must print THIS checkout's path.
3. **Full suite**: `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q`. Must be
   green — report the exact pass/skip counts.
4. **Docs honesty sweep**: for each code area the diff touches, check the
   mapped docs (DOC_MAP in .claude/hooks/docs-reminder.py) — if the change
   makes a doc claim wrong, fix the doc + its docs/INDEX.md currency tag as
   part of this same change.
5. **Constitution check**: for a behavior-changing diff, re-read
   `.specify/memory/constitution.md` and verify the diff violates no principle
   (and that the change came through a `.specify/specs/` spec per
   .claude/rules/speckit-workflow.md). A violation ⇒ stop and address it.
6. **Commit**: conventional message ($ARGUMENTS if provided, else derive one),
   body says WHY + names the regression test, ends with
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
7. **Push + PR**: `git push -u origin <branch>`, then `gh pr create` — body
   covers what/why, the named regression test, the suite counts, and any
   constitution-check notes; ends with
   `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`.
8. Report the PR URL, diffstat, suite counts, AND the net-LOC line:
   `code Δ: +A/−B · tests Δ: +C/−D` (from `git diff origin/main --numstat`,
   split devclaw/+runner/ vs tests/). Informational, never a gate — the
   number exists so growth is a choice, not a drift (ruled 2026-08-27).
   Do NOT merge — merging is the owner's call unless already authorized this
   session.
