"""PostToolUse(Bash) hook: after a git commit that touches code but no .md,
inject a reminder naming the docs that describe the changed areas.

Non-blocking by design — the commit stands; this asks for a conscious doc
check before the PR goes up (CLAUDE.md: fix the doc in the same PR, update
its currency tag in docs/INDEX.md). Many commits legitimately have no doc
impact; the right response then is a one-line "no doc impact" and moving on.

DOC_MAP is audited by the docs-audit skill — keep it in sync with docs/INDEX.md.
Set DEVCLAW_DOCS_HOOK_ALL=1 to skip the HEAD-recency guard (testing/debugging).
